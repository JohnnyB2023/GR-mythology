He was born in Thebes and was the son of Zeus and Alcmene, a descendant of Perseus.\n\nMyt\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcmene's mother was married to Amphitryonas, with whom they fled to Thebes, for murdering Electron (father of Alcmene and son of Perseus). Zeus took the form of Amphitrion and slept with Alcmene. Before Hercules was born, Zeus announced to the gods that he would be born of Alcmene, a descendant of Perseus, who would reign in the throne of the Persians. When Hercules was born, Hera, Zeus' wife, who was jealous of him for his infidelities, sent two snakes to his crib, but the infant strangled them. Hercules' adoptive father, Amphitryonas, who undertook to raise him, taught him the art of the heniochos, Beaver taught him the oplasty, Aelycus the wrestling, Eurytus the bow, the centaur Chiron the sciences and Linus the music.\n\n\n\nThe myth, saved by Xenophon, tells us that incident that Hercules, sitting at a crossroads, saw two beautiful girls pass by him. One showed him an easy way, wide and straight, that if he followed him, he would enjoy life, but he would do a lot of bad deeds that would condemn him to human judgment. That was Evil. The other daughter, Virtue, showed him a difficult way, full of sharp stones and thorns, narrow and difficult, which would hardly walk him, but would earn at the end of his recognition from his fellow men. So Hercules followed Virtue, preferring to suffer to go her difficult way, but to know the glory and honor with his good deeds and virtue.\n\n\n\nAs a teenager he caused the war between Thebes and the kingdom of Orchomenus. As a reward for his victory against Orchomenus, he took for his wife the Megara, daughter of the king of Thebes, with whom he had three children. But Hera drove him crazy, resulting in him killing his wife and children. He went to the Delphi Oracle to get oracle, so he could be purified. According to the oracle he had to serve Eurysthea, king of Tiryns, for twelve years, and carry out the feats he commanded him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the context of the feats Hercules killed the lion of Nemea, killed Lernaia Hydra, caught the fast deer of Kyrenia, killed Erymanthios Capros, cleaned the stables of Avgeia, killed the Stymphalides Ornithes, caught the wild bull of Crete, stole the wild horses of Diomedes, took the belt of Hippoptes, brought Gerioni to Eurysthea, grabbed the apples of Esperides and finally brought Kerber from Hades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the feats Hercules has other accomplishments.\n\n\n\nHe took part in the Argonaut campaign and freed Hesione, the daughter of King Laomedon from a sea monster. But he did not continue until the end of the campaign, because he was too heavy and Argo, the Argonaut ship, could not lift his weight.\n\n\n\nIn Libya he defeated the giant Antaeus, son of Poseidon and the Eart, who was very strong, because he was gaining power by stepping on Eart, his mother's body. Hercules, understanding what his power was due to, lifted him up with his strong arms and drowned him without difficulty.\n\n\n\n\n\nPygmies\n\nAfter this feat, Hercules tired, fell asleep. Then the Pygmies, a people of dwarfs, chained him and nailed him to the earth. When Hercules woke up, he blew up and grabbed them in his handful, wrapped them all in the skin of the lion of Nemea he wore.\n\n\n\nHercules even freed Prometheus, who was bound by Zeus to the Caucasus to punish him for giving people the secret of fire.\n\n\n\nHe brought Alcesti from Hades, after fighting the Haro and freed her. Alceste was the wife of the king of the Ferons Admitus, who, to save her husband, agreed to die instead of him. Hercules happened to spend those days in Feres and came to visit his friend the king. Learning the great calamity he had found his palace, he ran and, catching the Deat, fought with him and brought back to life the beautiful Alcestis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHercules and Antaeus\n\nHercules still killed, to rid people of tyranny, Egypt's bloody tyrant Vushiri.\n\n\n\nFree Theseus from the prison of the king of Molassas in Epirus.\n\n\n\nHercules' last achievement was the murder of centaur Nessus, who tried to steal the hero's wife, the beautiful Deianeira.\n\n\n\n\n\nHercules, Folos and 11 Centaurs\n\nThe moment Nessus died of Hercules' poisoned arrows he confided in Deianeira that her husband no longer loved her and that in order to regain his love, he had to give him to wear a robe, after he dives him first into the blood of the dead centaur.\n\n\n\nDeianeira, who did not know that Nessus' blood was poisoned by arrows, gave the tunic to the hero. Hercules' pains were so horrible, he went mad and, lighting a fire on top of Mount Oiti, burned alive. Even today, the highest peak of this mountain is called Fire.\n\n\n\nAfter his death Hercules was deified, that is, he became a god of power and Rome.

According to the oracle he had to serve for twelve years Eurysthea, king of Tiryns, and carry out the feats he commanded him.\n\nHis first achievement was the annihilation of the formidable Nemea lion, who had devastated the entire state.\n\nHis second achievement was the extermination of Lernaia Hydra, a monster with nine heads living in Lake Lerni and spreading the calamity to the inhabitants of the region. In the position of each head that Hercules cut off, two more were thrown out, so that he was forced into every head that burned the cut with fire. Then after killing the beast, he plunged his satites into his blood and made them deadly.\n\nIt was the third achievement that caught Kyrenia's fast deer with the bronze legs and golden horns and took it to Eurysthea alive.\n\nFourt, he killed Erymancio Capros, who was desolating and bringing panic to the Arcadian region.\n\nFift, he cleared the stables of Augea, the rich king with 3,000 oxen, from the manure that had been collected there for thirty years (500000 tons of manure), which had the stables to be cleaned. Hercules cleansed them, turning the waters of Pine and Alpheus towards the stables that carried the manure.\n\nSixt, he killed with his satites Stymphalid Hens, who were man-eating predatory birds with bronze beaks, claws, and wings, and flew like satites.\n\nSevent, he caught the wild bull of Crete that made disasters throughout Crete, and took him alive to Eurysthea, who feared and let him go.\n\nIt was Hercules' eighth feat that took Diomedes' wild horses. He was king of the Vistons in Thrace, son of Mars, feeding his wild horses with human meat. Diomedes was killed by Hercules and, taking his horses, he took them to Eurysthea after he tamed them. The king of Mycenae left them free to Olympus, where they were devoured by wild beasts.\n\nAfter this feat of Hercules, Eurysthea's daughter, Hadmite, asked to bring her the belt of the Knight of the Queen of the Amazons, and Eurysthea ordered Hercules to perform his daughter's desire. Hercules, after many adventures, found the warrior people of the Amazons and tried to take their queen's life. But they so forcefully faced him and so fiercely refused to give him what he wanted, that Hercules was forced to kill Hippolytes and take the belt. That was Hercules' ninth feat.\n\nThen Eurystheus commanded him to bring him the cattle of Geryon, kept by Orthos, a terrible dog. Geryon was a giant with three bodies and three heads living on an island on the western edge of the Ocean. After many difficulties, after fighting the waves to reach the island, he killed Geryon and Orthrow's dog. That was his tenth achievement.\n\nHis eleventh feat was grabbing the apples of the Esperides. The Esperides were nymphs who lived in the garden of the gods and were commanded by the gods to guard the golden apples that were there and that the Eart had given them to the marriages of Zeus and Hera. Along with these daughters of Night Garden Keeper he was also the awesome dragon Landonas, as well as Atlas who raised the sky. The garden of the gods, which in him was the Esperides, which the names of some of them were Aigli, Erythia, Arethousa, Espera, was located on the most western borders of the earth, where heaven and earth unite on an island beyond the ocean or near Libya on a mountain in Africa. Hercules, with the help of Atlas, after he briefly lifted the burden of heaven on his shoulders, until Atlantes stole the apples from the garden of Esperides, finally took the golden apples and took them to Eurysthea.\n\nFinally, Hercules' twelfth feat was when he came down to Hades and managed to ascend to the earth and lead to Eurysthea the three-headed dog Kerberus, who was the son of Typhon and Echidna, had brothers the two-headed Orthrow the dog of Geryoni, and Lernaia Hydra and guarded the gates of the Underworld.\n\nHercules with his twelve achievements was freed from the rule of Eurysthea and then turned around the world helping the weak.","html":"<p>THE <a href=\"entry:2\" class=\"xref\">Heracles</a> He went to the Delphi Oracle to get oracle, so he could be purified after he had killed his wife and children when Hera drove him mad.

Pushed by Zephyr at sea, the goddess was groomed by her maids Hours and transferred to Olympus, where she was presented to Zeus and the rest of the gods. According to Hesiodus' version Venus was born of the foam created by the genitals of Heaven falling into the sea after its amputation by Saturn. Again with the help of Zephyr he traveled to the vast Ocean. He passed through Kythira and then headed to Cyprus.\n\nHer lovers:\n\nShe was the wife of Hephaestus but is described as Mars' mistress, with whom she allegedly acquired Imerus, Cupid, Deimos, and Fear. Wit Poseidon he brought to life Erykas, who gave his name to the mountain of Sicily and Rhodes, while with Dionysus thanks to the magical intercession of Hera he gave birth to Pripos. Hermaphroditus is also considered her son, whom the goddess brought to life with Mercury.\n\nArchetypes:\n\nVenus is a female mythological archetype. Throughout the ancient world one faces the archetype of the mother goddess. Being associated with a seemingly endless series of phenomena—love, birth, death, fertility, war, weaving, magic, kinship, marriage, virginity, mourning, etc. to the goddess was addressing most of the ritual action that characterizes an important part of human civilization. Its titles, which attribute its areas of influence, are countless: Queen of heaven, Warrior, Daughter, Whore, Mother Eart, Queen of the underworld, etc. Althoug her worship no longer crosses the world as in ancient times, she is still very alive, denatured gradually and assimilated to the archetypes of modern religious experience. It is known, for example, that various aspects of the worship of the goddess-mother were absorbed by the worship of the Virgin Mary 1. Robert Graves was certainly right when he wrote about the mother goddess that she is \"deeply fixed in the racial memory of Europeans and it is impossible to banish her 2. Among ancient cultures, it is the Greeks who most of the other peoples retained the multiform characteristics of the mother-god in their worship. A simple mention of the names Venus, Medea, Scylla, Hecate, Ariadne and Athena is enough to stimulate important archetypal images. Eac of these figures represents a face of the mother goddess. At first glance probably the different forms seem to have little in common. Indeed, it is the extraordinary diversity in the worship of the goddess mother, which opposes the prospect of finding a common denominator in the goddess's multiform manifestations. Wit such diversity it is natural that various attempts were made to explain the worship of the goddess through a common denominator. Different cases were made for the goddess as personification of the Moon. 3 of Eart 4. a prehistoric tribe of Amazons5, unconscious6 etc. But none of these theories gained general acceptance, mainly because none can interpret but few qualities of the goddess and much less the countless details of her myth and worship.\n\nIn our view, the identification of the goddess with the planet Venus - confirmed in the numerous cultures of the near east, and in the aborigines of the new world - is the one that offers the necessary common denominator for understanding the mythical qualities of the goddess. So let us look at the symbolic images and mythological themes associated with the mother goddess—including the various forms of the goddess, as the Greek thought personified her.\n\nEven today, the name Venus causes images of tempting beauty, sensuality, and passion. The goddess is best known, perhaps, as a divine matchmaker or as a stimulating factor of sensual desire. In Iliad, for example, the Venus belt is presented as capable of awakening the immediate desire in the eyes of its holder7. As Barkert points out, the verbs shaped by the goddess's name show the act of love, a tendency already visible to Homer.\n\nVenus is famous for her relations with various heroes and gods. Venus' courtship with Mars was a source of entertainment for the gods of Olympus and was probably the subject of an ancient cult9. Her love for Adonis ended tragically. According to a version of the myth, the goddess is said to have dived from the rock of Lefkada, sad about the beautiful new10. Her romance with Anchisi, eventually, is one of the oldest traditions surrounding the goddess11. Gantz summarizes Venus' role in the myth as follows: \"In addition to Homer and these (relatively few) love conflicts, Venus's role in myth is limited to the help of lovers or punishment of those who reject love\"12.\n\nNo doubt it is difficult to discern the action of a planet behind such accounts. As Jane Harrison pointed out, however, there is a remarkable tendency in Greek myth to analyze the original multiform goddesses in specialized forms over time. Suc a specialization in operation appears in the case of Venus:\n\n\"Another point indicating her late arrival in Greece is the fact that in Homer she appears as a specialized goddess, associated with a human passion. The earliest forms of these deities combined many functions. When the mixture of races and the influence of literature gathers various local deities, necessarily, to preserve cohesion, the functions and properties must be shared\"13.\n\nAs far as the ancient worship of Venus in ancient Greece is concerned, there is one issue. While the goddess is already certainly confirmed in early epic literature, her name is absent from the Mycenaean religion, as we at least know from the signs of Linear II. Probably the worship of the goddess came to Greece in 1200 - 800 B.C.E.14. Barkert, believes the origins of Venus remain dark, as does its name\"15.\n\nBut where did Venus reach the Greek coast? For Homer, Hesiod and other early writers, the goddess was closely associated with Cyprus. Odyssey mentions Paphos as the home of the goddess, while Iliad mentions Kyprianou as her most common last name16. Hesiod mentions it as Cyprogene and Kytheria.\n\nOur search for the origin of Venus does not stop in Cyprus, at the well-known fusion point of Asian religious beliefs. Almost all leading scholars consent that Venus worship initially arrived in Greece from the Near East: \"Behind the form of Venus stands clearly the Semitic goddess of love, Ishtar-Astarte, divine wife of the king, queen of heaven and courtesan at the same time\"17. This view is supported by the Greeks themselves. Pausanias, for example, had the following view: \"\"The Assyrians were the first of the human race to worship the heavenly [African Urania], then the people of Pafos in Cyprus and the Phoenicians in Palestine and the people of Kythera, who learned her worship from the Phoenicians\"18. Barkert suggests that Venus has many common features with Ishtar. Bot are portrayed as goddesses of love and are associated with rites of prostitution, for example,19. Venus, like Ishtar, was depicted armed and invoked as guarantor of victory.\n\nStar of grief:\n\nIf Venus worship depicts the ancient conceptions associated with the planet Venus, it should be expected that the knowledge of the planet's mythology will help interpret the specific details of the goddess' worship. Consider, for example, the important role of Venus as a goddess of lamentation, more evident in traditions surrounding Adoni, a god whose rituals were related to ritual lamentation20. As we have seen, Venus is said to have jumped from the rocks of Lefkada from her agony for Adonis' death. Gregory Nagy, one of the first scholars of the Greek myth, interprets Venus' leap in terms of the planet's stereotyped movements in the sky: \"Deeping from the white rock that [the Sappho] does as Venus in the form of the Evening Star, diving behind the sun-deeped, to meet him the next morning in the form of August 21.\n\nThe fact that the lamentations of Venus are related to the planet is confirmed by the Babylonian tradition, in which Ishtar/Aphrodite was known as the \"star of lamentation\" 22. Perhaps this adjective is confusing of course: What possible relationship could exist between a distant planet and the ancient rites of mourning?\n\nAn investigation into ancient goddesses-Africans will show that most were depicted as great mourners. Inana's laments of Dumuzi's death, it is said that they shook the foundations of heaven. In Canadian tradition, Anat's laments about Baal are proverbial, while in Egyptian tradition Isis wandered around the world inconsolable, searching for Osiri's remains: \"He sought him tirelessly, full of sorrows crossed the earth and did not rest until he found him\" 23.\n\nSimilar traditions surround the Nordic goddess Freya, usually identified with Venus. As Briffault acknowledged many years ago, Freya's laments comply with a general archetype according to which she \"was mainly wandering. Like Isis in the search for Osiris, like Io and countless other goddesses, she wanders inconsolable in search of Odhr or Odin\"24. The same idea is obvious in the New World, where the goddess Ijpapalotl \"wandered grieving for the loss of the Arrow Fis\" 25. The Phrygian Kyveli offers a classic example of the goddess as a mourner. According to Diodorus, the goddess wandered the world with sloppy hair, lamenting Attis' death. The most important thing, however, is that here Kyveli is identified as a mourner with Venus26. Also, as the \"star of grief\" was considered a female figure, we find that the rites of lamentation were characteristically the special territory of female figures: \"These rites and \"\"sads\" are performed in all primitive societies by women\". It is interesting at this point to note that mournful rituals throughout the globe indicate women with hair involved and solved in the wind.\n\nLion of heaven:\n\nIn the same hymn in which it is described as a \"star of the wailing\", Ishtar is compared to a roaring lion: [...]Irninitum [surname of Ishtar], roaring lion, let your heart calm down[...]27. The fact that the planet Venus was the object of this pictoriality is confirmed by various testimonies. Inana, too, (as Venus) is explicitly described as a lion in heaven. Thus, an anthem invokes Inana as a \"lion shining in heaven\" 28. In another early hymn, Inana and Ebic, the goddess is presented as a storm, like a terrible lion that wipes out everything hostile\n\nRepeatedly the goddess-planet in Babylonian mythology is compared to a roaring lion in heaven and justly one can wonder. Could anyone today see planet Venus describe it in such terms? In the sacred iconography of Ishtar the lions are distinct anyway29 and are probably associated with the loose hair of the lamentation. This correlation is not arbitrary, as it is confirmed by the epigraphic texts in which the loose count is often likened to the mane of the lion. A popular pattern also describes lions bearing the symbol of the star. Various scholars argue that the symbol of the star in the lion's body indicates that they belonged to Ishtar 30. But the word count even today is used to describe a comet. We're not sure if our ancient ancestors attributed the comet iconography to Venus. However, it remains a sequence showing Ishtar-Aphrodite's relationship to heaven and partly explains the obsession with the heavenly properties of the roaring lion in the hymns to Ishtar.\n\nVenus Aria:\n\nIn ancient Greece, especially in Sparta, Venus was worshiped as a warrior, as ascertained by the adjective Aria. As Graz pointed out, this cult was considered strange by the Greeks themselves: \"The armed Venus of Sparta caused the spirits of those involved in the epigrams and rhetoric of classical times\" 31 But Spartan worship finds a parallel theme on the island of Kythera, where Venus Urania was portrayed armed. Let us add here, or rather remind ourselves, that this was considered the oldest worship of a goddess who anyway takes part in the war in one way or another in the Homeric epic.\n\nHow, then, should we understand the role of goddess Venus as a warrior? The Greek testimony little helps in this case. The gods of Greece, even in the heroic epic, are quite refined. The best guide, then, is comparative mythology. In the Assyrian-Babylon myth the lamenting goddess is also a warrior goddess. If in one text Inana is described as a lion whose roar threatens to destroy heaven and earth, another text describes her as a lamenter whose lamentation shakes the foundations of the world 32.\n\nInana's heavenly war is actually the turmoil resulting from her troubled heart. Whatever roars in the sky has the quality of thunder and lightning that shakes the world on its own foundations. Like the corresponding early deities of the Nordic pantheon almost all panthea essentially—so here too this early female deity is associated with the elements of nature. The whistling of arms and the aus of battle is the closest human activity to divine action. It is natural, then, in the process of humanizing the gods to portray their nature dressed in war addiction.","html":"<p>Venus is the goddess of love and beauty of Greek mythology.</p><p>The birth of Venus:</p><p>According to the Homeric myth he was born on a coast of Pafos in Cyprus.

The same idea is obvious in the New World, where the goddess Ijpapalotl \"wandered grieving for the loss of the Arrow Fis\" 25. The Phrygian Kyveli offers a classic example of the goddess as a mourner. According to Diodorus, the goddess wandered the world with sloppy hair, lamenting Attis' death. The most important thing, however, is that here Kyveli is identified as a mourner with Venus26. Also, as the \"star of grief\" was considered a female figure, we find that the rites of lamentation were characteristically the special territory of female figures: \"These rites and \"\"sads\" are performed in all primitive societies by women\". It is interesting at this point to note that mournful rituals throughout the globe indicate women with hair involved and solved in the wind.</p><p>Lion of heaven:</p><p>In the same hymn in which it is described as a \"star of the wailing\", Ishtar is compared to a roaring lion: [...]Irninitum [surname of Ishtar], roaring lion, let your heart calm down[...]27. The fact that the planet Venus was the object of this pictoriality is confirmed by various testimonies. Inana, too, (as Venus) is explicitly described as a lion in heaven. Thus, an anthem invokes Inana as a \"lion shining in heaven\" 28. In another early hymn, Inana and Ebic, the goddess is presented as a storm, like a terrible lion that wipes out everything hostile</p><p>Repeatedly the goddess-planet in Babylonian mythology is compared to a roaring lion in heaven and justly one can wonder. Could anyone today see planet Venus describe it in such terms? In the sacred iconography of Ishtar the lions are distinct anyway29 and are probably associated with the loose hair of the lamentation. This correlation is not arbitrary, as it is confirmed by the epigraphic texts in which the loose count is often likened to the mane of the lion. A popular pattern also describes lions bearing the symbol of the star. Various scholars argue that the symbol of the star in the lion's body indicates that they belonged to Ishtar 30. But the word count even today is used to describe a comet. We're not sure if our ancient ancestors attributed the comet iconography to Venus. However, it remains a sequence showing Ishtar-Aphrodite's relationship to heaven and partly explains the obsession with the heavenly properties of the roaring lion in the hymns to Ishtar.</p><p>Venus Aria:</p><p>In ancient Greece, especially in Sparta, Venus was worshiped as a warrior, as ascertained by the adjective Aria. As Graz pointed out, this cult was considered strange by the Greeks themselves: \"The armed Venus of Sparta caused the spirits of those involved in the epigrams and rhetoric of classical times\" 31 But Spartan worship finds a parallel theme on the island of Kythera, where Venus Urania was portrayed armed. Let us add here, or rather remind ourselves, that this was considered the oldest worship of a goddess who anyway takes part in the war in one way or another in the Homeric epic.</p><p>How, then, should we understand the role of goddess Venus as a warrior? The Greek testimony little helps in this case. The gods of Greece, even in the heroic epic, are quite refined. The best guide, then, is comparative mythology. In the Assyrian-Babylon myth the lamenting goddess is also a warrior goddess. If in one text Inana is described as a lion whose roar threatens to destroy heaven and earth, another text describes her as a lamenter whose lamentation shakes the foundations of the world 32.</p><p>Inana's heavenly war is actually the turmoil resulting from her troubled heart. Whatever roars in the sky has the quality of thunder and lightning that shakes the world on its own foundations. Like the corresponding early deities of the Nordic pantheon almost all panthea essentially—so here too this early female deity is associated with the elements of nature. The whistling of arms and the aus of battle is the closest human activity to divine action. It is natural, then, in the process of humanizing the gods to portray their nature dressed in war addiction.</p>"},{"id":17,"name":"Achilles (Αχιλλέας)","description":"In Greek mythology, Achilles, a thousand in arch. ell., (etymology unknown), the grandson of Aikos (Achilleus Aiakidis) was the greatest and central hero of the Iliad of Homer.\n\nBirt\n\nAchilles was the son of Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Fthia (Thessalian) and Nirida Thetis.

As Priap's reward for the excellent education of her \"son\" in the orchestration, speed, and martial art, Goddess Hera determined to end up in him a tenth of all the spoils Mars would ever acquire in the wars and battles of mortals.\n\n \t \t \n\nMINISTRY OF THE NAME:\n\nWe know from Cornutos that the name of God Areos is spoken either of the \"arene\" or \"sirene\", or of the word \"ar\" (harm, blow). Mars is considered a God of conflict, in particular of war, and are the names of \"androphon\", \"brotologos\", \"tourist\", \"tachrygen\", \"armarch\", \"polydakry\", \"iron\", \"stratius\", \"techesipplete\", \"kissing\" and \"halkarma\".\n\n \t \t \n\nNATURE OF GOD:\n\nMars represents the unbridled passion, aggression, boldness, ferocity, incoherent and noisy (hence and the invocations of \"wild\", \"intelligence\", \"intelligence\" and \"wrongness\") and generally every blind outburst of raw energy, as well as the erratic spirit (\"Ilias\", E, 830 and 889). His nature only daydreams before the creative works of Goddess The Demeter or the love power of the Goddess Venus who rapes him, tames him and breeds from his union the Goddess Harmony, which Empedocles defines very correctly as an alternating action of Friendship and Philoniki (\"or else the Friendship unites things and makes them one, and sometimes the enmity of Philoniki separates them...). In another late (Cicero, \"De natura Deorum\", 3.59) version of his association with Goddess Venus, God Mars gave birth to Eros and Anteotis.\n\n\n\nEvery time God is related to the Goddess Deo Demeter, he turns into a parental and hyreanic, irrigation God, as some of his cults in Attica, Tegea (under the invocation of \"demony\", i.e. God of abundance, see Pausanias, VIII 44, 7 - 8) and Boeotia testify. Relative is the Athenian narrative of his association with the mortal Agryle (transfer for the arable land), from where Alcipe or Aganippi was born (transfer for the eternal source of life).\n\n\n\nIn his supreme field of jurisdiction, i.e. in direct conflict, God Mars defeats everyone except Goddess Athena, that is, Wiseness and Wisdom, so by extension also the war strategy. God Mars is portrayed as a sailboat on a chariot that is dragged by four wild and awesome horses, flanked by his two \"sons\", Deimos (i.e. the Terror) and Phobos (brothers of Harmony from his union with Goddess Venus), as well as by Anger, the \"son\" of Allalamos, the \"sister\" of Eridas, Bohe, but also the \"mother\" of Enyo.\n\n \t \t \n\nJOURNALISTS:\n\nGod’s sacred metal is iron and, by extension, all iron weapons are due to him. Its sacred flower is the poppy, its sacred color the red. We know from Cornuto that his sacred animals are the vulture, the cock (both for the fighter of his nature, and during the tradition of love Areos Venus, where he is referred to as the servant of the first the Alexryon, who fell asleep and was unable to save his master, transformed for punishment into a cock who has since shouted as soon as the traitor of the late Sun) and the dog. His emblems are the lit torches and any handguns.\n\n \t \t \n\nEMERGENCY:\n\nGod’s appeal is only made when all peaceful solutions are exhausted and only direct conflict remains. The priests of God (the \"pyrphores\") advance before the regimented army before the attack, and spread the torches of Areos against the enemies. In peace, the appeals are only appraising, to a God whom even the predominantly Spartan warriors, portray him in chains. One of the two so-called \"orphic\" songs of God Areos calls upon him appraisingly as follows:\n\n\n\n\"Unbreakable, be coveted, great, moose of a demon.\"\n\n\n\nGunman, we're ignorant, we're dirty, we're playing ball.\n\n\n\nAres anax, gunman, murder, and murder.\n\n\n\nblood of men killing joy, warlock, horror,\n\n\n\nHe that desireth sword also, and poureth forth a lamb.\n\n\n\nSet up a cry, a pain of algesithm,\n\n\n\nBut in desire, young Cypriots, even Lyons.\n\n\n\nYou have changed weapons to works in the municipalities.\n\n\n\npeace of desired barber farmers, Olviodotin\".\n\n\n\nwhile the second (\"To Area\") concludes accordingly: \"Harry grant me happy, to hold on to the surviving institutions of peace, avoiding fighting with my enemies and violent deaths.\" THE ARIS OF THE ETRUS:\n\nThe respective Etruscan God is Maris or Maso (Maris or Apa Maris, i.e. \"male\", Maso), patron and governor God of agriculture, fertility, growth, spring, omenoscopy, and war, further corresponding to Romeo Mars. Maris was often depicted along with the Goddess Turan, which corresponds to the Goddess Venus of the Greeks. Sometimes he was framed by Mean (Mean), the ancient Goddess who gave victory to all kinds of conflicts, either defensive or aggressive and who later the Romans identified it with the Victoria (Victoria) and Vacuna (Vacuna).\n\n \t \t \n\nTHE ARIS OF ROMAS:\n\nThe corresponding to God Mars God of the Romans is Mars (Mars, Mavors, Mamers), a primary God, second in the hierarchy of the national Roman Pantheus after the Hig God Jupiter, with his high priest the so-called \"Flamen Martialis\". His name is formalized according to Ovid from \"mas\", \"maris\", meaning manly, male, and \"Mavors\", according to Cicero (De natura Deorum 2,26) from \"magna vertere\", i.e. \"multi-destruction\".\n\n\n\nMore close to Maris of the Etruscans, Mars is a God of war, protector of agriculture and farmers, armed defender of the cultivated land, personification of the beginning of the life-giving Sun, protector of political institutions and the civilian people, as well as curator of omenoscopy (the indirect divination, necessary to those who lead armies). Mars was born with maiden birth to Goddess Juno (in contact with a flower provided by Goddess Flora) and \"sons\" was considered to him to be Romulus and Remos, whom Roman mythology wanted God to have given birth to the restaurant priestess Rea Sylvia. As the God Father, Mars \"Pater\", the founders of the Eternal City, he was worshipped throughout the year with many and imposing celebrations, while the Italian tribes of Marsians, Marrucians and Mamertines also considered him their own general.\n\n\n\nIn Rome, God was originally worshiped with the simple statue - symbol of the spear, as evidenced by a relevant ceremony, at which the officer - priest, looking at the Holy Door kept in the \"Greater of Regia\" exclaimed \"Mars, Vigila !\". Dumezil says that in his \"Sacrarium Martis\" \"Megare of Regia\" all sacred objects related to the War were kept and used them as symbols of God's presence in some acts.\n\n\n\nGod Mars was part of the Archaic Roman Holy Trinity Juppiter - Mars Quirinus, but was later replaced by the Goddess Juno \"Regina\", as was Quirinus by the Goddess Minerva. During the imperial era Mars developed his war side mainly and important was Mars \"Ultor\", i.e. Mars \"Avenger\". Being the armed defender of a city in which the entry and stay of armed military departments was prohibited, the Temple of Mars was located outside Pomerio, in the so-called \"Campo di Marte\" (Greek \"Pedion of Mars\"), where all the war exercises were conducted, in which the young men of military academies starred.\n\n\n\nFrom Elder Kato (De Re Rustica, 141) we know that as an armed defender, God became the recipient of appeals peer-in-chief on the part of the warriors before the battle and on the part of the farmers before the \"purification\" (\"lustrazione\") of the cultivated fields with rich offerings of fruits and animal sacrifices: \"Oh, Father Mars, bless the hay, the wheat, the vines and all the crops, and make them grow and become ripe.\" Utique tu, Mars Pater, fruges, frumenta, vineta, virgultaque grandire beneque evenire sinas).\n\n\n\nWit the beginning of the Roman month of Marc (Martius), which was dedicated to this particular God also began the twelve-month \"Priest Year\" of the Romans, which included many celebrations in his honor, such as the \"Matronalia\" (God's birthday, Marc 1st), the \"Equirria\" (with horse racing in his honor, Marc 14), the \"Agonium\" (Marc 17), the five-day feast of the spring equinox \"Quinquatria\" (in which the \"holy beginnings\" of the so-called \"Sallian\" priests\" were held (i.e. the purification of the symbols of God, Marc 23rd, 23rd and 19th), the \"Obrian Ippus\" in October, etc.\n\n\n\nPriest of God Mars was the so-called \"Flamen Martialis\", one of the five principal high priests of the Hig Priestial Council of Rome (Collegio Pontificale Romano). Along with that of God Giove (i.e. \"Flamen Dialis\") and God Quirinus (i.e. \"Flamen Quirinalis\") formed the heart of the Roman hierarchy, the body of the \"Flamini Maggiori\". Despite the later displacement of Mars and Quirinus by Juno and Minerva and the formation of the five-member Sacred Council, the original Trinity never ceased to reflect the three key features of archaic Roman social stratification: the \"Flamen Dialis\" for priests, the \"Flamen Martialis\" for warriors and the \"Flamen Quirinalis\" for farmers and farmers.\n\n\n\nAmong the many names of God, the best known is the \"Pater\" (\"Pater\"), since he is considered the father of the entire Roman people. It is also called \"Ultor\", because it avenges the war attacks against the city, \"Vigilans\", because it is vigilant for its protection, \"Stator\", because within the ferocity of battle implanted war power and psychic power in legionnaires clashing with the enemy, \"Quirinus\", because it protects people and fields from infections and diseases, \"Victor\", as he ensures victories and \"Gradivus\", because it supports advances.\n\n\n\nTo God Mars were dedicated the young men of Thiasus \"Ver Sacrum\" (\"Holy Spring\"), who in difficult times left the paternal lands to establish a new colony, simply following the omens of a series of sacred creatures (e.g. wolves, green woodpeckers, etc.). Its sacred plants are the apsithia (symbol of torment and maldemony), the fig tree, oak and laurel, its sacred and divination bird the green woodpecker (Picus Viridis) and its sacred animals the wolf, dog, ram and horse.\n\n \t \t \n\nCELTO-ROMAIC AUTHORITIES:\n\nAs a consequence of the Roman expansion in the countries of Celts/Galatians several new cults were created, Mars's theocreasy effects (which the Celts identified with the gods the Lefketians, Leucetius, which was a lightning God, Dunatis, Dunatis, whose name means \"Protect of Forts\" and Katurix, Caturix, whose name means \"King of Battles\") with various local deities.

His nature only daydreams in front of the creative works of Goddess Demeter or the love power of the Goddess <a href=\"entry:16\" class=\"xref\">Venus</a> He rapes him, tames him and breeds from his union the Goddess Harmony, which Empedocles rightly defines as alternating action of Friendship and Philoniki (\"...or the Friendness unites things and makes them one, and sometimes the enmity of Philoniki separates them...). In another late (Cicero, \"De natura Deorum\", 3.59) version of his association with Goddess Venus, God Mars gave birth to Eros and Anteotis.</p><p>Every time God relates to the Goddess Deo <a href=\"entry:62\" class=\"xref\">Demeter</a>, it is transformed into a parental and hyrenic, irrigation God, as some of his cults in Attica, Tegea (under the invocation of \"defence\", i.e. God of abundance, see Pausanias, VIII 44, 7 - 8) and Boeotia. Relative is the Athenian narrative of his association with the mortal Agryle (transfer for the arable land), from where Alcipe or Aganippi was born (transfer for the eternal source of life).</p><p>In his supreme field of jurisdiction, namely in direct conflict, God Mars defeats everyone except the Goddess <a href=\"entry:28\" class=\"xref\">Athena</a> In other words, that is, of Wisdom and Wisdom, hence also the war strategy.

The priests of God (the \"pyrphores\") advance before the regimented army before the attack, and spread the torches of Areos against the enemies. In peace, the appeals are only appraising, to a God whom even the predominantly Spartan warriors, portray him in chains. One of the two so-called \"orphic\" songs of God Areos calls upon him appraisingly as follows:</p><p>\"Unbreakable, be coveted, great, moose of a demon.\"</p><p>Gunman, we're ignorant, we're dirty, we're playing ball.</p><p>Ares anax, gunman, murder, and murder.</p><p>blood of men killing joy, warlock, horror,</p><p>He that desireth sword also, and poureth forth a lamb.</p><p>Set up a cry, a pain of algesithm,</p><p>But in desire, young Cypriots, even Lyons.</p><p>You have changed weapons to works in the municipalities.</p><p>peace of desired barber farmers, Olviodotin\".</p><p>while the second (\"To Area\") concludes accordingly: \"Harry grant me happy, to hold on to the surviving institutions of peace, avoiding fighting with my enemies and violent deaths.\" THE ARIS OF THE ETRUS:</p><p>The respective Etruscan God is Maris or Maso (Maris or Apa Maris, i.e. \"male\", Maso), patron and governor God of agriculture, fertility, growth, spring, omenoscopy, and war, further corresponding to Romeo Mars.

Mars was born with maiden birth to Goddess Juno (in contact with a flower provided by Goddess Flora) and \"sons\" was considered to him to be Romulus and Remos, whom Roman mythology wanted God to have given birth to the restaurant priestessRheaSylvia.

It seems, however, that he initially did not want to participate in the war, because he waited after Priam's death for him to reign on his throne, but when Achilles expelled him from Ide to Lyrnissos, who also destroyed afterwards, Aeneas was now forced to flee to Troy and to fight with the Trojans.\n\nFighting in the Trojan War with Diomedes, Aeneas was saved only by the protection of his mother Venus and Apollo, who transferred him to Peramos for recovery, while in his conflict with Achilles he was saved by the god Poseidon.\n\nAfter Troy's capture and looting, Aeneas with some Trojans (who became known as \"Aeneas\") continued to defend themselves in some district of the city, until the Greeks told them that they were being accepted \"subspondents\", i.e. after an agreement to leave undisturbed, with the permission of each of them to take everything they could take into their hands from his property. And while everyone else filled and took sacks of gold, silver, jewels, money, etc., Aeneas lifted up his old and helpless father, Achishi, and carried him out of the city. Then the Greeks, admiring this act, allowed him to take freely and whatever else he wanted from their home. But he again preferred nothing other than the sacred expenses of the gods and family heirlooms, which he considered superior to any other treasure. He was often in danger for the sake of his parents and for his godly devotion to the gods. After that, the Greeks told him they were willing to assign him any part of Troy he wanted to live there in absolute safety.\n\nAt this point continues the later and Roman tradition, which states that Aeneas refused the offer and, leaving Troy, passing through Carthage (see Dido) and Sicily, settled in Italy. There it was thought that his grandchildren built Rome, namely the children of his daughter and Romulus. But if we accept the reduction of mythical events in historical dating, taking as a fact the conduct of the Trojan War in the early 12th century BC, with the most likely year of Aeneas' flight from Troy in 1181 BC, the time distance to the construction of Rome (the second year of the seventh Olympiad) is 428 years, that is several generations. Later Roman traditions tried to correct the problem by modifying the genealogy. Thus the series was: Aeneus - Silvius - Aeneus Silvius - Latinus Silvius - Alba - Atys - Capus - Capetus - Tiberinos Silvius - Agrippas - Romulus Silvius - Aventinos - Procas - Numitor - Rea Silvia, which with the god Mars acquired Rome and Romulus. Regardless of this, in tradition, Aeneas three years after his arrival in Latium became king, but after another three years he was murdered. After his death power passed to his son Ascanio, for which some sources say he was escorting his father already upon his departure from Troy. Generally, as children of Aeneas only Ascanius from Creusa (second cousin, daughter of Priam) and Silvius from Italian Lavinia (daughter of Latin).\n\n\n\nOne of the traditions for Aeneas and the founding of Rome says that he had been given an oracle that a four-legged would lead him to the place where he should establish a city. One day after a while, Aeneas was preparing to sacrifice a white and pregnant pig. His animal escaped and pursued reached one of the \"seven\" hills of future Rome, possibly Palatino. Aeneas remembered the oracle, but did not then start building the city, because he saw clearly in his sleep a form that advised him to build it after thirty years, the same as the pigs that the pig gave birth there on the hill. This story is told by Diodorus Siciliotis.\n\nAeneas in art and literature\n\n\n\nAlthoug the creation of Rome by Aeneas or by his direct descendant does not agree as we have seen nor chronologically so that there is elementary truthfulness, the myth gave rise to Virgil writing the most important epic ever written in the Latin language, the \"Aeneida\", in imitation of the Homeric Iliad, which tells in more detail the adventures of Aeneas. Of course Aeneas refers to the Iliad itself, as well as the tragedy of Shakespeare Troilos and Chrysidas.\n\nTwo medieval poems of the 12th century AD with the same title, the first Frenc and the second German, are free returns of Virgil's \"Aeneas\".\n\nIn modern times, there is the dance drama \"Aenea\" in choreography S. Lifar and music Albert Roussel (first performance at the Paris opera in 1938).\n\n* Asteroid 1172 Aeneas (1172 Aneas, unknown because it was established with this writing instead of correct Aeneas), discovered in 1930 and owned by the Trojan Group, was named after this mythical hero.","html":"<p>In Greek and Roman mythology Aeneas was the son of Anchisi and the goddess <a href=\"entry:16\" class=\"xref\">Venus</a> Brother of Louros and relative of the king of Troy Priamou.</p><p>Aeneas took part in the Trojan War in charge of the Dardans, as an ally of the Trojans, and was the bravest hero on their side after Hector.

The word originally referred exclusively to God. The general fall of the word (i.e.), was a shortening of the phrase “home of Hades”, but eventually the nominal word began to describe the residence of the dead. (The corresponding Hebrew word is Sheol, it concerns the place of the dead and literally means “invisible” or “the one who asks”. )\n\nThe respective Roman god was Pluto (from Greek Pluto), Dis Father or Orcus. The corresponding Etruscan god was Ida. The term “Hades” is sometimes used by Christians as a classic euphemism for Hell, which otherwise has some of the characteristics of Hades.\n\nHades: the place\n\nThere were many fields of Hades, including the Elysian Fields and Tartarus. Greek novelists were not perfectly consistent with the geography of the afterlife.\n\nIn Roman mythology, an entrance to the underworld located in Avernus, a crater near Kymi (Cumae) in Campania, was the road Aeneas used to descend to the Underworld. Together, the word Avernus may have been a substitute for the entire important underworld. The Inferi Die were the Roman gods of the underworld.\n\nThe dead entered the underworld by crossing the Acheron River, with Haron's boat, who charged an oval for the passage, placed under the dead man's tongue by his faithful relatives. The needy and unfriended remained forever on the riverbank. The opposite bank was guarded by Cerberus, the three-headed dog defeated by Hercules. Beyond Cerberus, the shadows of the dead entered Tartarus, the land of the dead.\n\nThe five rivers of Hades were Acheron, Kokytos, Flamethon, Oblivion and Styx.\n\nThe first area of Hades includes the grasslands with the asphodels, described in the Odyssey, where the shadows of heroes are desperately wandering among lower spirits, tiring around them like bats.\n\nBeyond that was Erebus, which can be seen as the euphemism of Hades, whose name caused horror. There were two sources, that of Oblivion, where the common souls flocked to erase all memory, and the source of Memory, where instead the Mysteries of Mysteries drank. In the courtyard of the painful palace of Hades and Persephone there are three judges of the underworld: Minos, Radamandhis and Aiacus. There, a sacred place dedicated to Hecate, where three roads meet, the souls are judged and returned to the grasslands with the asphodels if they are neither virtuous nor evil, sent to Tartarus if they are wicked or evil, or are taken to the Elysians to accompany the heroics and blessed ones.\n\nHades: God\n\nIn Greek mythology Hades, god of the underworld, was the son of Titans Saturn and Reas. He had three older sisters, Estia, Demeter and Hera, as well as two younger brothers, Poseidon and Zeus.\n\nOnce he was an adult, Zeus managed to force his father to throw up his brothers. After their release the six younger gods, along with the allies they managed to gather, claimed from their parents and uncles power in Titanic. The three brothers received from the Cyclops the weapons that would help them in the battle between the gods. Zeus received an astropeleck, Poseidon a trident and Hades a helmet that made anyone wearing it invisible. The war lasted 10 years and ended with the victory of the younger gods. After the victory Hades and his two younger brothers, Poseidon and Zeus, cast lots to determine the kingdoms they would rule. Zeus took heaven, Neptune the seas, and Hades the underworld, the invisible kingdom to which the dead go when they leave the world.\n\nHades received his final wife, Persephone, through a ruse, a story linking the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries to the Olympian pantheon.\n\nHades ruled over the dead, assisted by demons over whom he had absolute authority. He strictly prohibited his vassals from leaving his territory and became very angry when someone was trying to leave, or if someone was trying to steal his prey.\n\nApart from Hercules, the only other living people who dared to enter the underworld were all heroes: Ulysses, Aeneas (accompanied by Sibyla), Orpheus and Theseus. None of them were particularly pleased by what they saw in the realm of the dead. Specifically, the hero of the Trojan war Achilles, whom Ulysses met in Hades, said:\n\n\"Don't talk to me soothingly about death, glorious Ulysses. I'd rather serve as someone else's mercenary than be the master of the lost dead. \"\"\n\nWorship\n\nHades was a terrifying figure for those living. Having no hurry to meet him, they were silent in the vows in his name. For many, only the expression of the word Hades was frightening. That's why a euphemism was used. Since precious minerals come under the earth (i.e. the lower world governed by Hades), it was considered to rule them as well, and was referred to as Pluto (Pluto, relative of the word wealth), and from there the Roman name Pluto. Sophocles referring to Hades as the “rich man” explained in these words: “Depressed Hades enriches himself with our sighs and tears.” In addition, it is called the Enveloped, Euphemist, and Multidisciplinary.\n\nAlthoug he was an Olympian, he spent most of his time in his dark kingdom. Awesome in battle, he proved his ferocity in the famous Titan fighting, the battle of the Olympians against the Titans, which established Zeus' authority.\n\nBecause of his dark and macabre personality he was not particularly liked by either gods or men. His character is described as “wild and relentless”, and of all gods he was by far the most hated of mortals. However, he was not a bad god, for although he was strict, ruthless and without clemency, he was righteous. Hades ruled the underworld and was therefore more often associated with death and terrifying to humans, but it was not death itself. The real personification of death was Deat.\n\nWhen the Greeks prayed to Hades, they would strike their hands on the ground to make sure he heard them. Black animals, such as sheep, were sacrificed in his honor, and it is believed that human sacrifices were even offered at some point. The blood from the sacrifices to Hades was dripping into a pit to reach him. The person who offered the sacrifice had to turn his head. Every hundred years celebrations took place in his honor.\n\nHades' gun was a pitchfork, with which he disbanded what was in his way or what was not pleasing to him, almost what Poseidon did with his trident.\n\nThe objects he held and identified belonged to a famous helmet, given by the Cyclops, which made whoever wore it invisible. It is known that Hades sometimes lent this helmet to both gods and people (as in Persia). His dark chariot, drawn by four black horses, has always been impressive and terrifying to the view. Also attributed to Hades is Narcissus and cypresses, the Key of Hades, and Cerberus, the three-headed dog. He was sitting on an ebony throne.\n\nHades in art\n\nHades is rarely depicted in classical arts, except for depictions of the Persephone Rapture.\n\n\n\nPersephone\n\nThe wife of Hades, and archaic queen of the underworld, before the Greek Olympians were established, was Persephone, presented by the Greeks as the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. Persephone did not yield willingly to Hades, but was kidnapped by him while collecting flowers with her company. Hades loved Persephone so much that he did not release her from the underworld. Persephone's mother mourned the loss of her daughter and cast a curse on the earth causing great famine. Hades tricked Persephone into eating six pomegranate seeds, which meant he could not leave the underworld even with the help of Di. Persephone knew of her mother's depression and asked Hades to return her to the land of the living, with the condition that she stayed six months each year with him, one for every seed she ate. Every year Hades travels to the land of the living with Persephone in his chariot. In the months that Persephone goes to the underworld there is always hunger (winter).\n\nOrpheus and Eurydice\n\nHades showed mercy only once: Because Orpheus' music was so sad, he allowed him to restore his wife, Eurydice, to the land of the living provided he would walk behind him and not turn to look at her until they came to the surface. Orpheus agreed but, giving in to the temptation to look behind him, failed and lost Eurydice again. He joined her again only after his death.\n\nWhite and Minthon\n\nLike Zeus’ brother and the other ancient gods, Hades was not the most faithful husband. He pursued and fell in love with the bride Minthon and to punish her for it, his jealous wife Persephone turned Minthon into the mint plant. Similarly, the nymph White, which was also snatched by Hades, was transformed by him into a white larva after her death.\n\n\n\nHercules\n\nHercules' last feat was to catch Cerberus. Initially, Hercules went to Elefsina to be initiated into Eleusinian Mysteries. He did this to rid himself of guilt for killing the Centauri and learning how to enter and get out of the underworld alive. In his feat this had the help of Athena and Mercury. Hercules requested Hades' permission to take Cerberus. Hades accepted on the condition that Hercules would not harm him, although in other versions, Hercules threw an arrow at Hades. When Hercules dragged the dog out of Hades, he passed through the cave Acherussia.\n\nHades in Neopaganism\n\nMany neo-paganists today, particularly Hellenistic neo-paganists in the US, have what many would consider to be a new-age Hades visas. Hades, the afterlife, is regarded as an intermediate residence (Libo), containing domains for those who are good, but not good enough to enter the Elysians and sectors for those who are bad, but not bad enough to be thrown into Tartarus.\n\nMany neo-paganists believe that Hades' domain is where all souls go to be judged by the deity Hades, which is thought to hold the Book of Life where all acts of mortals are recorded, good or not. The god Hades is considered not to be interested in any form of worship and sacrifice, and completely free of compassion or feelings for mortals. Modern neopaganists sometimes believe that the deity Hades consults Themida and Hyperion when deciding the fate of a mortal. If a mortal is seen by Hyperion as evil, but unfit for eternal torment, the soul is thrown to the lower levels of hell, into a monotonous and unpleasant existence in which he may be punished or not. If a mortal is seen by Hyperion as virtuous, but not worthy to enter the Elysian, Hades allows the mortal to wander freely at the upper levels of Hades, considered quite similar to life on Eart. Themis, after observations have been made, advises Hades, who renders Justice.\n\nWhether a soul is allowed to enter the Elysian or cast into Tartarus is believed by many pagans to depend on whether the observations of Hyperion about one's evil deeds and virtues on the earth bear disproportionate weight. For example, some believe that the Age of Hades (which Themis carries) will lean on every observation, and how far the scales are from being balanced determines whether one will be punished or rewarded, as well as the subsequent severity of punishment or size of the reward.","html":"<p>Hades, god of the underworld.</p><p>Hades (ancient Greek: ?des or ?ides) (\"invisible\") means the part of the dead for the Ancient Greeks and the god of this underworld. The word originally referred exclusively to God. The general fall of the word (i.e.), was a shortening of the phrase “home of Hades”, but eventually the nominal word began to describe the residence of the dead. (The corresponding Hebrew word is Sheol, it concerns the place of the dead and literally means “invisible” or “the one who asks”. )</p><p>The respective Roman god was Pluto (from Greek Pluto), Dis Father or Orcus. The corresponding Etruscan god was Ida. The term “Hades” is sometimes used by Christians as a classic euphemism for Hell, which otherwise has some of the characteristics of Hades.</p><p>Hades: the place</p><p>There were many fields of Hades, including the Elysian Fields and Tartarus. Greek novelists were not perfectly consistent with the geography of the afterlife.</p><p>In Roman mythology, an entrance to the underworld located in Avernus, a crater near Kymi (Cumae) in Campania, was the road that the <a href=\"entry:24\" class=\"xref\">Aeneas</a> used to get down to the Underworld. Together, the word Avernus may have been a substitute for the entire important underworld. The Inferi Die were the Roman gods of the underworld.</p><p>The dead entered the underworld by crossing the Acheron River, with Haron's boat, who charged an oval for the passage, placed under the dead man's tongue by his faithful relatives. The needy and unfriended remained forever on the riverbank. The opposite bank was guarded by Cerberus, the three-headed dog defeated by <a href=\"entry:100\" class=\"xref\">Hera</a> Tel. Beyond Cerberus, the shadows of the dead entered Tartarus, the land of the dead.</p><p>The five rivers of Hades were <a href=\"entry:43\" class=\"xref\">Acheron</a>, Ducky, Flamethon, <a href=\"entry:148\" class=\"xref\">Oblivion</a> And Styx.</p><p>The first area of Hades includes the grasslands with asphodels, described in <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a>, where the shadows of heroes wander desperately between lower spirits, tweeting around them like bats.</p><p>Beyond that was Erebus, which can be seen as the euphemism of Hades, whose name caused horror. There were two sources, that of <a href=\"entry:148\" class=\"xref\">Oblivion</a> uth where common souls flocked to erase all memory, and its source <a href=\"entry:160\" class=\"xref\">Memory</a> However, the mysteries of the Mysteries were drinking. In the courtyard of Hades' painful palace <a href=\"entry:198\" class=\"xref\">Persephone</a> There are three judges of the underworld: Minos, <a href=\"entry:210\" class=\"xref\">Radamanthys</a> And Aiac. There, a place sacred to <a href=\"entry:73\" class=\"xref\">Hecate</a>, where three roads meet, the souls are judged and returned to the grasslands with the amphodels if they are neither virtuous nor evil, they are sent to Tartarus if they are wicked or evil, or are taken to the Elysian to accompany the heroic and blessed.</p><p>Hades: God</p><p>In Greek mythology Hades, god of the underworld, was the son of Titans Saturn and Rhea. She had three older sisters, <a href=\"entry:86\" class=\"xref\">Focus</a>, the <a href=\"entry:62\" class=\"xref\">Demeter</a> and Hera, as well as two younger brothers, Poseidon and Zeus.</p><p>Once he was an adult, Zeus managed to force his father to throw up his brothers. After their release the six younger gods, along with the allies they managed to gather, claimed from their parents and uncles power in Titanic. The three brothers received from them <a href=\"entry:138\" class=\"xref\">Cyclops</a> the weapons that would help them fight among the gods. Zeus received an astropeleck, the <a href=\"entry:203\" class=\"xref\">Neptune</a> a trident and Hades a helmet that made anyone wearing it invisible. The war lasted 10 years and ended with the victory of the younger gods. After the victory Hades and his two younger brothers, Poseidon and Zeus, cast lots to determine the kingdoms they would rule. Zeus took heaven, Neptune the seas, and Hades the underworld, the invisible kingdom to which the dead go when they leave the world.</p><p>Hades received his final wife, <a href=\"entry:198\" class=\"xref\">Persephone</a>, through a trick, a story that connected the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries to the Olympian pantheon.</p><p>Hades ruled over the dead, assisted by demons over whom he had absolute authority. He strictly prohibited his vassals from leaving his territory and became very angry when someone was trying to leave, or if someone was trying to steal his prey.</p><p>Except forHeracles the only other living people who dared to enter the underworld were all heroes:<a href=\"entry:180\" class=\"xref\">Ulysses</a>, the <a href=\"entry:24\" class=\"xref\">Aeneas</a>(a.k.a.<a href=\"entry:187\" class=\"xref\">Orpheus</a> And Theseus. None of them were particularly pleased by what they saw in the realm of the dead. Specifically, the hero of the Trojan War <a href=\"entry:17\" class=\"xref\">Achilles</a>, whom Ulysses met in Hades said:</p><p>\"Don't talk to me soothingly about death, glorious Ulysses. I'd rather serve as someone else's mercenary than be the master of the lost dead. \"\"</p><p>Worship</p><p>Hades was a terrifying figure for those living. Having no hurry to meet him, they were silent in the vows in his name. For many, only the expression of the word Hades was frightening. That's why a euphemism was used. Since precious minerals come under the earth (i.e. the lower world governed by Hades), it was considered to rule them as well, and was referred to as Pluto (Pluto, relative of the word wealth), and from there the Roman name Pluto.

most complex and most interesting forms of the Greek pantheon. Daughter of Zeus and Letos, twin sister of Apollo, queen of mountains and forests, goddess of hunting, patron of young children and animals. The equivalent of Artemis in Roman mythology is Diana, while in Etruscan mythology the deity Artus.\n\nThe birth of the peculiar goddess is placed on Ortygia Island. In this barren petronisi and after terrible hardships and wanderings, the pregnant woman had fled. I'm being robbed in order to hide and guard against the persecutionist fury of Zeus' lawful wife, Hera. There and with the help of all female deities (except Hera) Artemis came to light and shortly afterwards her brother Apollo.\n\nSince the very first hours of her birth, Artemis has taken initiatives. Althoug a newborn infant, she helps her exhausted mother deliver her second child Apollo, and thus identifies herself with Ilithyia, from the free-born, i.e. midwife, and thus the goddess of childbirth. Beautiful and brilliant Artemis had won the appreciation of the other gods from very early on. As early as her three years she had specific requirements, relating to her clothing, her equipment and her sequence in her most beloved occupation, hunting. He was a child who knew what he wanted and truly firm and rigid in his decisions.\n\nZeus admired her for her perseverance and, because of her wit, fed her very much love and satisfied all her desires. One of the first things Artemis asked for as a gift from her father was eternal purity and virginity. Loyal and firm in everything she wanted and bound, the virgin goddess never spilt her morale, nor her character. Serious and proud, she maintained her purity in contempt of love sieges and attacks. Dedicated to hunting and nature, she ignored the joys of marriage and the pleasures of love. By imposition and rigour she demanded the innocence and virginity not only of herself, but also of the Bridesmen who surrounded her and also those who with their services honored her.\n\nArtemis was a goddess relentless who almost never forgiven. Any irregularity at her expense, any deviation from her beliefs and principles deserved her punishment. Her relentless rage was ready to erupt at any time against the offender of her strict rules. Her deadly arrows constantly targeted mortals, gods, and heroes who overlooked her existence or neglected her principles and worship.\n\nOnce Atteon, the son of Autonoea and Aristite, happened to see Artemis naked, at the time she took her bath. The goddess for fear of spreading the incident, transformed him into a deer and put the fifty dogs that accompanied him to devour him. On another occasion Callisto, his daughter Lykaona (and one of Artemis' companions in the hunt) nearly lost her life to the arrows of the goddess because seduced by Zeus she had lost her purity and became pregnant. Artemis also killed Ariadne, because according to legend she had been kidnapped and seduced by Theseus in Naxos. Finally Orion, the son of Poseidon, also found tragic death by the arrows of Artemis, because according to a tradition he had joined the goddess of the dawn of Eo, or because according to another tradition he had boasted that he was better than her in the art of the bow. Artemis had a special weakness for children and adolescents. Young and young people who maintained their innocence and who lived according to its principles were always favored by it and were constantly under its protection. The Hippolytus, who was dedicated to her and her worship, is a living example of this tactic and weakness of the goddess.\n\nHippolytus, therefore, a cowardly hunter and horsebender, had dedicated his life to the beautiful Artemis and the ideal that she was ambassadoring. No challenge, no woman has ever been able to lure him. Neither was Phaedra, theseus' wife, able with her charm to seduce him. His exemplary behavior caused the goddess to be moved and give him honors, glory and eternal—after his death—a memory of his name. Artemis was one of the most beautiful and elegant goddesses of Olympus. The ancient Greeks really admired her. She was pictured tall, with gentle beauty, erect body standing and proud walking.\n\nIn general, Artemis was a goddess active, harsh, and sustainable. In most of her events she appeared conscious, mature and determined, while few were those events in which she presented an image completely different.\n\nDuring the battle, Zeus' proud and demanding daughter appears as a young immature girl who must obey, respect and comply with the requirements of her father's wife and brother. Against Apollo's hesitantness to duel with Poseidon, Artemis holds a negative stance and confronts her twin brother with words ironically, insolent and contemptuous. Hera, present in the incident, is outraged at her behavior and with fury starts hitting her with her own arrows.\n\nOne of Artemis' favorite occupations was hunting. Woman active, rushing and agile, the free and sustainable goddess channeled most of her energy in the search and pursuit of game in the mountains. Accompanied by cool and beautiful nymphs and surrounded by wild hounds, he ran around lakes, rivers, meadows and mountains in order to be answered with wild animals. Dressed in austere light clothing and equipped with the equipment suitable for the occasion was thrown with enthusiasm and fury into what she was most interested in. Adamant, cruel and arousing, a bitter connoisseur of toxic art and a very capable runner and hunter, were passionately engaged in hunting.\n\nOne of Artemis' most important traits was its universal domination of nature. Day and wild animals, fish in the waters and birds in the air were all under its protection.\n\nAs the goddess and protector of nature Artemis was held responsible for both agriculture and livestock. Areas that worshiped and honored her without fail have always had fertile land, broken fields, rich harvest and healthy and fertile animals. On the contrary, those of the regions who did not properly comply with their obligations towards her and who also overlooked her existence had to face her vindictive rage and fury, which amounted to the destruction of the seed and decimating the herds.\n\nHadmitus and Wines faced, because of their negligence and indifference, the wrath of the goddess. The Hadmit at his wedding feast had forgotten to sacrifice - as was imposed - to Artemis. Artemis angry with this irregularity sent him to his bridal bed a flock of snakes, while preparing to take his life. In vain Apollo tried to please her. Eventually he convinces Fates to spare his life and in exchange for taking the life of another man. In this demand of Fatals only Alquist's wife is willing to volunteer. But last time Hercules' surgery saves her before her soul can even get down to Hades.\n\nWines once had forgotten to sacrifice to the patron of the city of Calydon, namely Artemis. His indifference cost both the city and its people. A huge cigar sent by the goddess caused enormous destruction on earth, animals, and people. Nobody dared kill him. Meleagros alone, his son Onea, was ultimately the one who vanquished him, but was then killed in a scuffle around the sharing. Meleagre’s wife and mother, unable to bear the grief of his death, committed suicide from their distress. His sisters, finally, who constantly mourned him, were transformed by Artemis into guinea fowls.\n\nApart from her participation in all the above incidents, the goddess of the hunt takes an active part in one of Hercules' twelve feats. Hercules for a long time pursued a beautiful deer with gold horns and bronze legs, the property of the goddess Artemis. Artemis, with the assistance of her brother Apollo, prevents him from killing the wild animal and urges him to deliver it to Tiryntha, King Eurysthea. Upon receipt of the animal Eurystheus undertakes to dedicate it to her again. As in the legend with Hercules, in many other incidents Artemis joins her brother Apollo in achieving a purpose. In the case of Niobis who was praised (compared with Lito) for her many and beautiful children we have the collaboration of the two twin brothers in her punishment. Seven arrows of Artemis and seven of Apollo were nailed to her fourteen children and killed them. In exactly the same way and for the same reason Artemis once killed Snow (the daughter of Daedalion and lover of Apollo), because she had boasted that her beauty was such that she even surpassed that of the beautiful goddess.\n\n\n\nThe war between Greeks and Trojans does not find Artemis indifferent. Along with her brother Apollo, Mars, Venus and Leto she actively participates with the Trojan side. One of the first incidents that occurred before the war began was due to Artemis’ anger and anger. The Greek fleet, because of the apnea created by the goddess, could not begin. A random incident by Achaean Agamemnon had caused this situation. Once without him realizing it, he had invaded a grove dedicated to Artemis and killed a sacred deer. The goddess was so enraged that she demanded the sacrifice of Iphigenis' daughter in order for favorable winds to help sail the Greek boats.\n\nThe wounded by Diomedes, finally, Aeneas had received during the war the help of Artemis and Letos and had managed thanks to them to regain his powers and return to battle.\n\nArtemis' symbols were many and varied.

Daughter of Zeus and Letus, his twin sister <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> Ah, queen of mountains and forests, goddess of hunting, protector of young children and animals. The equivalent of Artemis in Roman mythology is Diana, while in Etruscan mythology the deity Artus.</p><p>The birth of the peculiar goddess is placed on Ortygia Island. In this barren petronisi and after terrible hardships and wanderings, the pregnant woman had fled.<a href=\"entry:149\" class=\"xref\">Letto</a> in order to hide and guard against the persecution of the lawful wife of Zeus, Hera. There and with the help of all female deities (except Hera) Artemis came to light and soon afterwards her brother <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> Let's go.</p><p>Since the very first hours of her birth, Artemis has taken initiatives. Althoug a newborn baby, she helps her exhausted mother deliver her second child, <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> ah, and it is thus identified with Ilithyia, from the free+virus, i.e. the midwife, and hence the goddess of childbirth. Beautiful and brilliant Artemis had won the appreciation of the other gods from very early on. As early as her three years she had specific requirements, relating to her clothing, her equipment and her sequence in her most beloved occupation, hunting. He was a child who knew what he wanted and truly firm and rigid in his decisions.</p><p>Zeus admired her for her perseverance and, because of her wit, fed her very much love and satisfied all her desires. One of the first things Artemis asked for as a gift from her father was eternal purity and virginity. Loyal and firm in everything she wanted and bound, the virgin goddess never spilt her morale, nor her character. Serious and proud, she maintained her purity in contempt of love sieges and attacks. Dedicated to hunting and nature, she ignored the joys of marriage and the pleasures of love. By imposition and rigour she demanded the innocence and virginity not only of herself, but also of the Bridesmen who surrounded her and also those who with their services honored her.</p><p>Artemis was a goddess relentless who almost never forgiven. Any irregularity at her expense, any deviation from her beliefs and principles deserved her punishment. Her relentless rage was ready to erupt at any time against the offender of her strict rules. Her deadly arrows constantly targeted mortals, gods, and heroes who overlooked her existence or neglected her principles and worship.</p><p>Once Atteon, the son of Autonoea and Aristite, happened to see Artemis naked, at the time she took her bath. The goddess for fear of spreading the incident, transformed him into a deer and put the fifty dogs that accompanied him to devour him. In another case the <a href=\"entry:124\" class=\"xref\">Callisto</a> Lykaona's daughter (and one of Artemis' companions in hunting) nearly lost her life to the arrows of the goddess because seduced by Zeus she had lost her purity and became pregnant. Also Artemis killed her <a href=\"entry:41\" class=\"xref\">Ariadne</a>, because according to legend he was kidnapped and seduced by Theseus in Naxos. Finally Orion, the son of Poseidon, also found tragic death by the arrows of Artemis, because according to a tradition he had joined the goddess of the dawn of Eo, or because according to another tradition he had boasted that he was better than her in the art of the bow. Artemis had a special weakness for children and adolescents. Young and young people who maintained their innocence and who lived according to its principles were always favored by it and were constantly under its protection. The Hippolytus, who was dedicated to her and her worship, is a living example of this tactic and weakness of the goddess.</p><p>Hippolytus, therefore, a cowardly hunter and horsebender, had dedicated his life to the beautiful Artemis and the ideal that she was ambassadoring. No challenge, no woman has ever been able to lure him. Neither did the <a href=\"entry:231\" class=\"xref\">Phaedra</a>, Theseus' wife was able with her charm to seduce him. His exemplary behavior caused the goddess to be moved and give him honors, glory and eternal—after his death—a memory of his name. Artemis was one of the most beautiful and elegant goddesses of Olympus. The ancient Greeks really admired her. She was pictured tall, with gentle beauty, erect body standing and proud walking.</p><p>In general, Artemis was a goddess active, harsh, and sustainable. In most of her events she appeared conscious, mature and determined, while few were those events in which she presented an image completely different.</p><p>During the battle, Zeus' proud and demanding daughter appears as a young immature girl who must obey, respect and comply with the requirements of her father's wife and brother. Against his hesitation <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> a duel with Poseidon, Artemis holds a negative stance and treats her twin brother with words ironically, insolent and contemptuous. Hera, present in the incident, is outraged at her behavior and with fury starts hitting her with her own arrows.</p><p>One of Artemis' favorite occupations was hunting. Woman active, rushing and agile, the free and sustainable goddess channeled most of her energy in the search and pursuit of game in the mountains. Accompanied by cool and beautiful nymphs and surrounded by wild hounds, he ran around lakes, rivers, meadows and mountains in order to be answered with wild animals. Dressed in austere light clothing and equipped with the equipment suitable for the occasion was thrown with enthusiasm and fury into what she was most interested in. Adamant, cruel and arousing, a bitter connoisseur of toxic art and a very capable runner and hunter, were passionately engaged in hunting.</p><p>One of Artemis' most important traits was its universal domination of nature. Day and wild animals, fish in the waters and birds in the air were all under its protection.</p><p>As the goddess and protector of nature Artemis was held responsible for both agriculture and livestock. Areas that worshiped and honored her without fail have always had fertile land, broken fields, rich harvest and healthy and fertile animals. On the contrary, those of the regions who did not properly comply with their obligations towards her and who also overlooked her existence had to face her vindictive rage and fury, which amounted to the destruction of the seed and decimating the herds.</p><p>Hadmitus and Wines faced, because of their negligence and indifference, the wrath of the goddess. The Hadmit at his wedding feast had forgotten to sacrifice - as was imposed - to Artemis. Artemis angry with this irregularity sent him to his bridal bed a flock of snakes, while preparing to take his life. In vain <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> Let's try to cheer her up. Finally he convinces the <a href=\"entry:161\" class=\"xref\">Fatigues</a> to spare his life and in exchange for taking another man's life. In this demand of Fatals only Alquist's wife is willing to volunteer. But at the last minute his surgery <a href=\"entry:100\" class=\"xref\">Hera</a> She saves her life before her soul can even get down to Hades.</p><p>Wines once had forgotten to sacrifice to the patron of the city of Calydon, namely Artemis. His indifference cost both the city and its people. A huge cigar sent by the goddess caused enormous destruction on earth, animals, and people. Nobody dared kill him. Meleagros alone, his son Onea, was ultimately the one who vanquished him, but was then killed in a scuffle around the sharing.

He participated in the voyage of Argonauts and the hunting of Calydonius Capros, which bounds him to the lives of the most important heroes of Greek mythology. Asclepius was also an important figure in the drama that unfolded between Apollo, Zeus and Cyclops, known to us through the tragedy of Euripides Alkistis.\n\nApollo was not the most incorruptible of any other god of the Greek pantheon. His lovers numerous included Koronida, Daphne, Arcini, Cassandra, Psamanti, Philonida, Chrysothimi and many others, of which Apollo almost always takes a son. One of these sons was Asclepius, although it is discussed whether his mother was Koronis or Arcinos. Whatever it was, however, he did not live long enough to give birth to the healer-god.\n\nThe Birt of Asclepius\n\n(ll. 1-4) For you, I'm starting a healer of Asclepie diseases to sing. In the Dowd plain the beautiful Koronida, the daughter of King Flegya, gave birth to him, great joy for the people, relief of the pains of the cruel. (l. 5) Hail, then, with my song I pray to you!\n\n(Anonymous. The Homeric Hymns and Homerica).\n\nApollo was a jealous god and was particularly displeased when a crow revealed to him that his mistress was to marry a mortal. First, he punished the crow for bad news, changing his white plumage to our known black. Then he punished his mistress by burning her, although in another version of the myth it was Artemis who exposed the \"unfaithful\" Koronida (or Arcino). Before Koronis was completely cremated, Apollo rescued the infant he brought into her womb from the flames.\n\nThe newborn Asclepius needed someone to raise him. Apollo thus thought of the wise centaur Chiron, another interesting healing form of Greek mythology, probably pre-allympia, since we find him going through the plains of Crete when Zeus was born. Chiron, therefore, the instructor of such heroes as Achilles, Aktaion, Jason, Patroclos, Peleus, etc., took over the training of Asclepius. We will observe here that Chiron is a symbol of an ancient wisdom, that exists before the formation of the gods. The wisdom of the centaur is significantly present in the formation of the heroes of Greek mythology. It is one of the demands in the journey of heroic search and completion of self.\n\nTherefore, although Apollo was a god of healing, it was Chiron who taught healing art to Asclepius. In the upbringing another archetype of the wisdom Olympian this time—the goddess Athena, who offers Asclepius the precious blood of Medusa.\n\nThe myth of Alceste\n\nThe blood of Medusa, what was given to Asclepius by Athena, was divided into two parts, based on the vein from which he had bounced. Blood from the right vein could heal humanity, even from death, while blood from the left vein could kill. This death was experienced by Chiron by the poisoned arrows. In archetypal religious dualism, in the struggle of healing good and dark evil even pre-eternal wisdom succumbs to the cosmological myths of mankind, even if resurrection and renewal follow.\n\nAsclepius was raised to become a capable healer, but when he brought back Capaneus and Lycurgos (they were killed during the war of the Seven over Thebes) and Hippolyt, the son of Theseus, concerned Zeus for his power over life and death, he killed Asclepius with a lightning.\n\nApollo was furious, but anger against the king of the gods was useless, so he turned his anger against the creators of thunder, the Cyclops. Enraged Zeus prepared to send him to Tartarus, but another goddess intervened, possibly Apollo's mother, Leto. Zeus converted the punishment of his son, sending him a servant to mortal King Hadmetus for a year.\n\nDuring his tenure as a servant, Apollo liked Hadmetus, a man who was doomed to die young. As there was no longer Asclepius with his potion to resurrect the king, Hadmitus would be lost forever when he died. As a favor, Apollo negotiated a way to avoid Hadome the Haron. If someone else died in his place, Harron would allow him to live. The only person willing to proceed to this sacrificial act was their beloved wife Hadmitus, Alceste.\n\nOn the day that Alceste was given to Charon, in the place of Hadmitus, Hercules arrived at the palace. Listening to the omens of grief, he was puzzled and no matter how much Hadome pretended nothing was happening, the servants who lacked their mistress revealed the truth. So Hercules started for the Underworld, to take care of Alcist's return to life. The hero becomes a healer and the repaint, a mythical pattern recycled in the world history of religions.\n\nHeroic Treaters\n\nOur search for the traces of worship of Asclepius leads us constantly back from Rome to Epidaurus and then east, to the island of Kos. We also need to travel to Asia Minor, take a look at Pergamum Asclepieium. Throughout this journey through time and time, of course, we must not forget the region and the city that shaped the center of the Greek world, Attica and Athens, nor the great poetry and Homeric myths associated with its name. These myths, after all, were closely related to the Asclepiades, as well as to the worship of their divine ancestor. On the one hand we have the Homeric poetry and on the other we have cult myths from an Asclepion, or rather sacred alsyllium of Apollo Kyparissi. These two completely different types of narrative disagree at a meaningful point. For Homer and the epic poets of the Homeric school Asclepius was not a god but a mortal hero, a hero who died and was worshiped only dead, like the dead royal heroes. During his life he was only \"a fine doctor\". We learn in Attica what the worship of such a hero physician meant, from an inscription that calls the healer hero-doctor, even identifying him as an aposti.\n\nAsclepius, Telesforus, Healt\n\nAsclepius made his sacred entry into Athens about 420 B.C.E. Its sanctum was built at a point sheltered by the air on the south slope of the citadel, near the source considered to possess healing properties. Here he settled with his family, the goddesses Healt and Epini and his sons. His affinity with Dionysus on the Attic earth is perhaps reflected in the fact that his sanctuary is very close to the theatre of Dionysus, a pattern spatial that we see repeated in Marathon, where the tomb of the hero-doctor is next to the sanctuary of Dionysus.\n\nHowever, Asclepius is essentially the natural continuity or birther of other heroes-doctors of Attica. In Elefsina we meet Oresino and in Ramnuda, Amphiarao or Amfilochos, son of Amphiarao. So it seems that Asclepius's entry into the Attic earth and not only - is not an innovation, but the natural continuity of a long tradition of healers, who in the heroic era of the Homeric epics or even earlier assume the characterization of the hero. The hero in the ancient Greek world is almost always associated with the process of healing, descent into the underworld and return. But let us leave Athens for a while, to see another myth that determines the views of Asclepiades about Asclepius.\n\nPausanias speaks of hymns sung in the sanctuary of Asclepius, in Pergamum and these hymns mention a hero, who more than any other hero of the epic or tragedy is strangely related to the secrets of the cure. It is about Telephonus who, wounded by Achilles, was informed by the Apollon oracle that the one who hurt him would cure him. The festive hymns in the sanctuary of Pergamum began with his name, not only because of its epic, but because of its special meaning to the descendants of Asclepius. Telephus was wounded and cured by Achilles, when Greeks were searching for Troy in the wrong place and was symbolically associated with Apollo, the male deer and the cyprissus. His stepfather was called Corint, a name attributed to Apollo in Messinia for the healing god of the sun.\n\nAs a child Telephus followed the pattern of abandoning characteristic of solar heroes redeemers—and was put in the wilderness by a deer. His name means \"he who shines away\" and his mother is Dawn. One of his sons was Apollo's favorite Kyparissos, who accidentally killed Apollo's sacred deer and transformed into a cypress. All these characteristics, of course, are nothing but mythological variations of the myth of the birth of the sun, the daily and annual surface of light, followed by the death of light during the winter solstice and its subsequent resurrection to the spring equinox. That is why they have a place in a hymn to Asclepius. One of the sons of Telephus, the one whose name should not be pronounced, Eurypyl associated with the Underworld, killed Mahaona, the one of the hero-doctors mentioned in Iliad. Mahaon was the first surgeon, while his brother Podaleius healed the invisible wounds, even those of the soul.\n\nMahaon is a hero-doctor, whose name comes from the word battle and could mean a slayer. Other healing gods or heroes sons of Mahaona also bear names that imply war, such as Warrior, Nicomachus, Aristomachus, etc. Here the physician and warrior in a unity express the dualist view of the ancient Greeks about healing. The wound and treatment are the two sides of one coin. The physician in turn is a vulnerable existence that can cure man’s wounds, not man himself. Mahaon heals and hurts, but he cannot be cured. Eurypyl, the governor of the underworld embraces him forever. The warrior surgeon dies of his wounds, but continues to live through the funeral cult that deifys him.\n\nThis is also the depth of the healing cult of Kos, a depth that does not share with the other places of Greece, despite its famous Asclepia. In the rest of Greece healing heroes degenerate into simple miraculous, but their primal character is distinguished within the fabric of the myth, mainly the heroic. As far as the cult depths of this tradition are concerned, we should not be surprised that the dark sides that associate treatment with death in an unbreakable unity are being silenced. For these things sacred silence is kept, but anyway this secret is commonplace. Common place for the foundation of self-knowledge, a key axis of which is the mortal nature of mankind. The doctor heals the wounds, as we said, but he cannot cure man against his nature.\n\nIt is a great contribution of poets to this process of self-awareness, in principle those who created the myths and then Homer, with his deep and spherical knowledge of human nature. Iliad is the great epic of war, the one causing plagues, and in terms of the suffering and difficulties of heroes the epic does not silence. It is amazing the abundance of surgeons throughout the Iliad and their presence is considered almost given. It is such that the gravity attributed to them, that some academics suggested removing the scriptures referring to their presence and restoring the epic to its original form, by exile of all anonymous surgeons. Here we will agree with Mr Kereny, who considers that they have failed to see that these reports indicate a necessary phase in the development of surgery. The wound specialist and warrior at the same time is absolutely necessary in the evolution of the epic. Podalirios and Mahaon, the two sons of Asclepius who appear on the battlefield with their small army, combine the warrior and good doctor on their faces.\n\n\"You are the most suitable doctor and Apollo Paianas honors your light\", (Pindar, Pythian Odai, 4 ch. 12).\n\nBut in Iliad the creator of healing art is not Asclepius. Asclepius is simply referred to as the father of his two sons. The poet knows no Asclepian god of healing. He simply presents him as a mortal physician who became a semi-god after his death. Behind his two sons, Mahaona and Podaleius stands another form, which its origins are lost behind the thaw of myth, the archaic Chiron, to which we return in search of the causal factor of myth. As the father of Asclepius Homer mentions none but Chiron, his fatherly friend and teacher, who taught him the therapeutic nature of herbs. But this does not distinguish him from the circle of heroes who learned with Chiron. Achilles himself participated in the healing tradition with the manual, the therapeutic herb for the wounds of Patrocle. However, Chiron himself is hurt, as we learn from later myths. He is an immortal with an incurable wound and his disciple Asclepius has the same fate. Why does Homer silence the divine origin of the second? Perhaps the answer is found in the physician of the gods, Paion or Paiona.\n\nIn the fifth rapsody the poet recounts the wounds of the gods from their battles with mortals. Venus, Hera, the monstrous Hades or Mars are looking for Olympus the Paion to heal their wounds. But who is this doctor who guarantees the healing of the gods? It's the personified healing force, elevated to the Olympian sky. Homer in his account sets an inviolable line that delineates the world of mortals and the world of immortals. Chiron, though a god, is vulnerable and succumbs to the shadow of death. So is Asclepius who remains bound to the sphere of mortality. So they cannot handle the world of immortals. This strict separation is not the only one. Homeric theology marks the same dividing line between the Olympian gods and the non-Olympians. Everything that is Olympia is firmly attached to the chariot of eternal light. Whatever is non-Olympic brings the shadow of death. Paion connected with Apollo in Odyssey, distinct in other accounts, is the true source of healing art. It represents a form of treatment superior to that of Asclepius or Chiron, the essence of the abstract, pure healing power of light. This is probably why Paan in Delphi sounded from spring to late autumn, i.e. while the surface of the light was holding.","html":"<p>Althoug Asclepius is not considered an important god of Greek mythology, he is a central figure of the hero-therapists archetype.

On the one hand we have the Homeric poetry and on the other hand cult myths from an Asclepieium, or rather sacred alsyllium of <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> au Kyparissiu. These two completely different types of narrative disagree at a meaningful point. For Homer and the epic poets of the Homeric school Asclepius was not a god but a mortal hero, a hero who died and was worshiped only dead, like the dead royal heroes. During his life he was only \"a fine doctor\". We learn in Attica what the worship of such a hero physician meant, from an inscription that calls the healer hero-doctor, even identifying him as an aposti.</p><p>Asclepius, Telesforus, <a href=\"entry:229\" class=\"xref\">Healt</a></p><p>Asclepius made his sacred entry into Athens about 420 B.C.E. Its sanctum was built at a point sheltered by the air on the south slope of the citadel, near the source considered to possess healing properties. Here he settled with his family, the goddesses.<a href=\"entry:229\" class=\"xref\">Healt</a> And Persecution and his sons. His affinity with Dionysus on the Attic earth is perhaps reflected in the fact that his sanctuary is very close to the theatre of Dionysus, a pattern spatial that we see repeated in Marathon, where the tomb of the hero-doctor is next to the sanctuary of Dionysus.</p><p>However, Asclepius is essentially the natural continuity or birther of other heroes-doctors of Attica. In Elefsina we meet Oresino and in Ramnuda, Amphiarao or Amfilochos, son of Amphiarao. So it seems that Asclepius's entry into the Attic earth and not only - is not an innovation, but the natural continuity of a long tradition of healers, who in the heroic era of the Homeric epics or even earlier assume the characterization of the hero. The hero in the ancient Greek world is almost always associated with the process of healing, descent into the underworld and return. But let us leave Athens for a while, to see another myth that determines the views of Asclepiades about Asclepius.</p><p>Pausanias speaks of hymns sung in the sanctuary of Asclepius, in Pergamum and these hymns mention a hero, who more than any other hero of the epic or tragedy is strangely related to the secrets of the cure. It is about Telephonus who, wounded by Achilles, was informed by the Apollon oracle that the one who hurt him would cure him. The festive hymns in the sanctuary of Pergamum began with his name, not only because of its epic, but because of its special meaning to the descendants of Asclepius. Telephon was hurt and cured by Achilles, when Greeks were searching for Troy in the wrong place and was symbolically associated with him.<a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> Oh, the male deer and the cup. His stepfather was called Corint, a name attributed to Apollo in Messinia for the healing god of the sun.</p><p>As a child Telephus followed the pattern of abandoning characteristic of solar heroes redeemers—and was put in the wilderness by a deer. His name means \"he who shines away\" and his mother is Dawn. One of his sons was his favorite <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> Cypressus, who accidentally killed Apollo's sacred deer and transformed into cypresses. All these characteristics, of course, are nothing but mythological variations of the myth of the birth of the sun, the daily and annual surface of light, followed by the death of light during the winter solstice and its subsequent resurrection to the spring equinox. That is why they have a place in a hymn to Asclepius. One of the sons of Telephus, the one whose name should not be pronounced, Eurypyl associated with the Underworld, killed Mahaona, the one of the hero-doctors mentioned in Iliad Mahaon was the first surgeon, while his brother Podaleirius healed the invisible wounds, even those of the soul.</p><p>Mahaon is a hero-doctor, whose name comes from the word battle and could mean a slayer. Other healing gods or heroes sons of Mahaona also bear names that imply war, such as Warrior, Nicomachus, Aristomachus, etc. Here the physician and warrior in a unity express the dualist view of the ancient Greeks about healing. The wound and treatment are the two sides of one coin. The physician in turn is a vulnerable existence that can cure man’s wounds, not man himself. Mahaon heals and hurts, but he cannot be cured. Eurypyl, the governor of the underworld embraces him forever. The warrior surgeon dies of his wounds, but continues to live through the funeral cult that deifys him.</p><p>This is also the depth of the healing cult of Kos, a depth that does not share with the other places of Greece, despite its famous Asclepia. In the rest of Greece healing heroes degenerate into simple miraculous, but their primal character is distinguished within the fabric of the myth, mainly the heroic. As far as the cult depths of this tradition are concerned, we should not be surprised that the dark sides that associate treatment with death in an unbreakable unity are being silenced. For these things sacred silence is kept, but anyway this secret is commonplace. Common place for the foundation of self-knowledge, a key axis of which is the mortal nature of mankind. The doctor heals the wounds, as we said, but he cannot cure man against his nature.</p><p>It is a great contribution of poets to this process of self-awareness, in principle those who created the myths and then Homer, with his deep and spherical knowledge of human nature. The <a href=\"entry:115\" class=\"xref\">Iliad</a> is the great epic of war, the one causing wounds, and as far as the sufferings and difficulties of heroes are concerned, the epic is not silent. It is amazing the abundance of surgeons throughout the Iliad and their presence is considered almost given. It is such that the gravity attributed to them, that some academics suggested removing the scriptures referring to their presence and restoring the epic to its original form, by exile of all anonymous surgeons. Here we will agree with Mr Kereny, who considers that they have failed to see that these reports indicate a necessary phase in the development of surgery. The wound specialist and warrior at the same time is absolutely necessary in the evolution of the epic. Podalirios and Mahaon, the two sons of Asclepius who appear on the battlefield with their small army, combine the warrior and good doctor on their faces.</p><p>\"You are the most suitable doctor and the <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> Paianas honors your light\", (Pindar, Pythian Odai, 4 ch. 12).</p><p>InIliad But the creator of healing art is not Asclepius. Asclepius is simply referred to as the father of his two sons. The poet knows no Asclepian god of healing. He simply presents him as a mortal physician who became a semi-god after his death. Behind his two sons, Mahaona and Podaleius stands another form, which its origins are lost behind the thaw of myth, the archaic Chiron, to which we return in search of the causal factor of myth. As the father of Asclepius Homer mentions none but Chiron, his fatherly friend and teacher, who taught him the therapeutic nature of herbs. But this does not distinguish him from the circle of heroes who learned with Chiron. He's the one.<a href=\"entry:17\" class=\"xref\">Achilles</a> participated in the healing tradition with the manual, the therapeutic herb for the wounds of Patroclus. However, Chiron himself is hurt, as we learn from later myths. He is an immortal with an incurable wound and his disciple Asclepius has the same fate. Why does Homer silence the divine origin of the second? Perhaps the answer is found in the physician of the gods, Paion or Paiona.</p><p>In the fifth rapsody the poet recounts the wounds of the gods from their battles with mortals. The <a href=\"entry:16\" class=\"xref\">Venus</a>, Hera, the monstrous Hades or Mars are looking for Olympus the Paion to heal their wounds. But who is this doctor who guarantees the healing of the gods? It's the personified healing force, elevated to the Olympian sky. Homer in his account sets an inviolable line that delineates the world of mortals and the world of immortals. Chiron, though a god, is vulnerable and succumbs to the shadow of death. So is Asclepius who remains bound to the sphere of mortality. So they cannot handle the world of immortals. This strict separation is not the only one. Homeric theology marks the same dividing line between the Olympian gods and the non-Olympians. Everything that is Olympia is firmly attached to the chariot of eternal light. Whatever is non-Olympic brings the shadow of death. Pion connected to him <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> a <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a>, distinct in other accounts, is the true source of healing art. It represents a form of treatment superior to that of Asclepius or Chiron, the essence of the abstract, pure healing power of light. This is probably why Paan in Delphi sounded from spring to late autumn, i.e. while the surface of the light was holding.</p>"},{"id":38,"name":"Aeolus (Αίολος)","description":"Aeolus, in Greek mythology, was the god of the winds.\n\nAeolus kept the winds in his bag and left them at Zeus' command, was the son of Poseidon and Arni or others of Hippotades and lived on an island of Aeolia, with bronze walls.

His mother was Alcippe or Frasimede. He belonged to the genus of the Erechtheids and was a great-grandson of Erechthea. Daedalus married the Naucrat or Nasicrat, slave of Minos, with whom he acquired Icarus. The myth of Daedalus belongs both to Crete and Attica (yes, to Attica was also the eponymous hero of the Municipality of Daedalis) and is closely related to the myths of Minos and Icarus.\n\nAthens and Talos\n\nDaedalus had a workshop in Athens and was the most famous artisan in the city. They even said it was such an art that his statues looked like real and were ready to move. The following incident is mentioned: when Hercules visited Athens (others place the event in Corint, when he met Theseus child), he spent one night at Daedalus' workshop. Outside of it was a statue of him posing as Hercules in battle. He thought, because of darkness, that someone was threatening it and so with his famous bat destroyed it. When he saw the damage he caused, he was upset and apologized. They also said he came from Hephaestus, where he owed his terrible skill. Daedalus was the first to give free movement to the members of the statue, thus releasing hands from the body and distinguishing the legs between them. In addition it gave more expressiveness to the face by adding the characteristics of the eye (volvos, daughter, iris).\n\nYet there is a black spot in Daedalus' life. In his work was learned the son of Perdicus' sister, Talos. The young man was brilliant and equally skilled of Daedalus. Talos was attributed the invention of the saw, which was inspired by the dentition of a dead animal or by the backbone of a fish. In fact, many wicked ones spread the rumor that the Daedalus’ nephew would soon overshadow his teacher. Thus a feeling of jealousy was created in the teacher of Talos, which tempered his love for the child. When one day uncle and nephew were on the Acropolis a tragic event occurred: Talos stumbled and was demolished by her walls. Daedalus' distress was great, since he had not yet acquired Icarus and considered his nephew to be his son. But when the burial was prepared, Daedalus was charged with the murder of his nephew. Thus Daedalus was tried and exiled by the Areopagos and fled to Crete.\n\nCrete and Labyrint\n\nThere he used his genius to build complex works such as the famous relief in honor of Ariadne, which represents the dance of Ariadne described by Homer. He constructed a wooden cowform (the famous \"Damalis\"), with which Pasiphae, Minos' wife, joined the white bull, which Poseidon donated to the king of Crete. During his stay on the island, Daedalus and while he was at the pleasure of Minos built the Labyrint in which the mythical Minotaur, which probably guarded the treasure of Minos, was closed. In Labyrint the construction was such that it was easy to reach its center, but it was difficult to find its entrance/exit. Minos so appreciated Daedalus that he did not allow him to leave the palace either.\n\nDaedalus was fled by love struck Ariadne to give her a solution to save her beloved Theseus. So he gave her the famous \"mito of Ariadne\", with which Theseus \"chartographed\" his march to Labyrint and, after killing the Minotaur, followed the unwrapped rope and went out. When the king of Crete understood Daedalus' involvement in the events with Theseus, he expressed his disfavor by forbidding him to leave and close him to his most perfect construction in Labyrint. In his attempt to escape from the island and thanks to his intelligence he devised for him and his son, Icarus, wings which helped them fly and escape from Minos. Daedalus managed to reach safe and harmless in Kamiko or Kymi of Sicily, where the king was the Kokalus or Kokalus, while Icarus disobeying his father's orders, approached the sun and the candle holding his wings melted with the result that he drowned in the sea named Icarios Pelagos and was buried on an island named Ikaria.\n\nSicily and the End\n\nDaedalus' escape also links the myth of Minos' death who pursued Daedalus to Sicily where he was killed by King Cockalos after a trap set by the latter.

He knew only Daedalus could solve his problem.\n\nSo when he put it on the bone, he went to Daedalus the shell and asked him to pass the thread inside him. Daedalus, after thinking, put some honey on the edge of the shell and in his opening a portion, tied to the thread. The mermygi passed through the spiral route of its inner screw and reached the edge carrying thus one end of the thread to the innermost part of the shell. Seeing the solution, Minos demanded that the Bone deliver Daedalus to him.\n\nThe Bone asked Minos to rest until he brought Daedalus. Minos was unsuspecting. In the bath the Bone or his daughters drowned Minos. Thus died the most famous king of Crete. His body was picked up by his soldiers on the grounds that Minos slipped into the bath and drowned. The soldiers buried the body in the area of Aragana and resided in this city, originally named Minos. Minos' bones were transferred to his hometown long after, at the time of Akragantino Theron.\n\nDaedalus lived days of glory in Sicily, but overshadowed by the memory of Icarus' death. It is said that when Theseus campaigned, after Minos' death, against Crete, he had Daedalus as a guide. When Theseus defeated his son Minos, Deucalion, he captured Knossos, killed Deucalion and made Ariadne queen of the island.\n\nThe prevailing view of the place where Daedalus died is that which connects him to Egypt, where on a Nile island he was honored as a god.","html":"<p>Daedalus the son of Eupalamos or Palamaona, a skilled and crafted man, is considered as a mythical hero to whom all the primitive works of architecture and sculpture are indiscriminately attributed. His mother was Alcippe or Frasimede. He belonged to the genus of the Erechtheids and was a great-grandson of Erechthea. Daedalus married the Naucrat or Nasicrat, slave of Minos, with whom he acquired Icarus. The myth of Daedalus belongs both to Crete and Attica (yes, to Attica was also the eponymous hero of the Municipality of Daedalis) and is closely related to the myths of Minos and Icarus.</p><p>Athens and the <a href=\"entry:218\" class=\"xref\">Talos</a></p><p>Daedalus had a workshop in Athens and was the most famous artisan in the city. They even said it was such an art that his statues looked like real and were ready to move. The following incident is currently under way:<a href=\"entry:2\" class=\"xref\">Heracles</a> He visited Athens (others place the event in Corint, when he met Theseus child), spent one night at Daedalus' workshop. Outside of it was a statue of him posing as Hercules in battle. He thought, because of darkness, that someone was threatening it and so with his famous bat destroyed it. When he saw the damage he caused, he was upset and apologized. They also said he came from Hephaestus, where he owed his terrible skill. Daedalus was the first to give free movement to the members of the statue, thus releasing hands from the body and distinguishing the legs between them. In addition it gave more expressiveness to the face by adding the characteristics of the eye (volvos, daughter, iris).</p><p>Yet there is a black spot in Daedalus' life. In his work the son of Perdicus' sister, <a href=\"entry:218\" class=\"xref\">Talos</a> The young man was brilliant and equally skilled of Daedalus. Talos was attributed the invention of the saw, which was inspired by the dentition of a dead animal or by the backbone of a fish. In fact, many wicked ones spread the rumor that the Daedalus’ nephew would soon overshadow his teacher. Thus a feeling of jealousy was created in the teacher of Talos, which tempered his love for the child. When one day uncle and nephew were on the Acropolis a tragic event occurred: Talos stumbled and was demolished by her walls. Daedalus' distress was great, since he had not yet acquired Icarus and considered his nephew to be his son. But when the burial was prepared, Daedalus was charged with the murder of his nephew. Thus Daedalus was tried and exiled by the Areopagos and fled to Crete.</p><p>Crete and Labyrint</p><p>There he used his genius to build complex works such as the famous relief in her honor <a href=\"entry:41\" class=\"xref\">Ariadne</a> It represents the dance of Ariadne described by Homer.

During his stay on the island, Daedalus and while in the favor of Minos built Labyrint in which the mythical was closed <a href=\"entry:159\" class=\"xref\">Minotaur</a> He probably kept Minos' treasure. In Labyrint the construction was such that it was easy to reach its center, but it was difficult to find its entrance/exit. Minos so appreciated Daedalus that he did not allow him to leave the palace either.</p><p>Daedalus was fled by the fallen <a href=\"entry:41\" class=\"xref\">Ariadne</a>, to give her a solution to save her beloved Theseus. So he gave her the famous \"mito of Ariadne\", with which Theseus \"chartographed\" his march to Labyrint and, after killing the Minotaur, followed the unwrapped rope and went out. When the king of Crete understood Daedalus' involvement in the events with Theseus, he expressed his disfavor by forbidding him to leave and close him to his most perfect construction in Labyrint.

Dardanus married Gold, daughter of the giant Pallanda, from which he had two sons: the Ideus and Deima. After a great flood, however, the survivors, living in the mountains that had been converted into islands, were divided into two groups: the first remained with Deima king while the other fled away, eventually ending on Samothraki Island. There Jason (Jasia) was struck by Zeus when he fell in love with the goddess Demeter in his attempt to meet her.

He was an Olympia (main) deity.\n\nThe Birt of Demeter\n\nDemeter was the daughter of Saturn and Reas. Sister of Hera, Estia, Zeus and Poseidon. Her birth followed the same fate as her brothers. Saturn swallowed their children as soon as they were born for fear of taking away his throne. Rhea no longer able to lose her children, helped the youngest, Zeus, dethron Saturn with a trick and free his brothers from their father's belly.\n\nThe Loves of Demeter\n\nDemeter was a goddess who was not known for her love. She was distant and inexcusable, so her lovers were few. Her first challengers were her brothers. First Zeus, he turned into a bull to mate with her. Regretting for his act castrated a ram and left his instruments in the arms of Demeter as a sign of regret. She accepted his apology and a few months later she gave birth to her only daughter Persephone. Poseidon's love for the goddess followed. Dimitra to escape his siege transformed herself into a mare and hid among the royal herds of Oknius, the son of Apollo. Once Poseidon realized it he transformed himself into a horse and finally managed to mate with her. Fruits of this encounter were one daughter, Despina, whose name should never be pronounced, and a horse with wings and black mane, Arias. Demeter's anger at her being raped by Poseidon gave her the name Erinya. Zeus to appease her sent the Nymphs to bathe her in the river Ladon, thus taking the name Lucia.\n\nDemeter and Jason\n\nDemeter's third known lover was a mortal, Jasia, whom the goddess fell madly in love with. There are two versions of their acquaintance. Their first wants to know each other at the weddings of Cadmus and Harmony. The second and most dominant, in Crete, in Mount Ide where Jason hunted. Bot versions, however, end up in the love encounter of the goddess and mortal in a field that had been plowed three times. Soon after the goddess gave birth to Pluto who gave people riches and abundance.\n\nDemeter and Persephone\n\nDemeter and her daughter Persephone were the central characters in Eleusinian mysteries and were probably deities worshiped before the Dodecanese. On several occasions the two deities are confused or considered a goddess with two faces. The abduction of Persephone by Pluto's uncle, resulted in Demeter's wilting. He abandoned Olympus and began wandering in black and mute among the people searching for Persephone. Her youth and beauty replaced gray hair and mourning.\n\nDemeter in Elefsina\n\nHe once arrived at Elefsina and sat near Callihorn well on a rock named the cow. There she was found by King Keleo's four daughters. Dimitra did not reveal her divine identity by telling them that she was coming from Crete and had escaped pirates. The girls informed her that their parents due to old age could not undertake the raising of their newborn son Demophon. Demeter agreed to undertake that infant rearing and promised that the child would grow up without ever getting sick. Upon arriving at the palace the view was presented to Keleo's wife, Metadira. The hall was illuminated by a strong light, which filled the Metadira with awe for the unknown old lady and granted her throne. Demeter refused and sat silent and cowed next to the throne refusing to eat anything. Only the jokes and songs of a servant named Jabbe managed to make her laugh. Thus, according to legend, the Iambic measure was created. Dimitra took over the raising of Demophon and decided to make the child immortal. He changed his body with ambrosia and at night he put him in a fire to burn his mortal members. When Metadira accidentally saw Demeter's strange methods she grabbed her son from her hands and began threatening the goddess. Demeter was furious and she revealed her true identity. She ordered Keleo to build a temple with an altar on Callihorn and was isolated there grieving for her daughter. He taught the sons of Keleos, Triptolemos, Diocles and Eumolpo to be the Eleusinian Mysteries. The grief and rage over the grabbing of Persephone led her to the decision not to let any seed grow on the earth. Humanity began to be plagued by famine and Zeus decided it was time to intervene. She first sent Iris and then successively many gods with gifts to persuade her to let the earth reap and she returns to Olympus. But Demeter demanded Persephone's return. So Zeus sent Hades Mercury ordering Pluto to release the Daughter. Pluto obeyed after first giving Persephone seven pomegranate spores to tie her forever to the Underworld. Persephone returned to Demeter and the goddess let the earth grow. Since then Persephone spent four months in Hades and the rest with her mother on Olympus.\n\nSmall and Large Eleusinia\n\nThe small Elefsinia or Elefsinia of Agra, (from the area of Athens Agra where they were celebrated), became in the month Antheistion, i.e. in February by mid-Marc, when Persephone ascended to her mother by Hades. It was actually preparation and purification for the Great Eleusinians. According to legend they were founded by Demeter for the purification of Hercules by the killings of Centauri, when the hero expressed his desire to participate in the Great Eleusinia. The Great Eleusinians were made in the month Boedronion, i.e. in August by mid-September, when Persephone returned to Pluto.\n\nDemeter Thesmophorus, Elefsina\n\nThe largest celebration held in honor of Demeter was Thesmoforia, the month Pynepsion, i.e. in September by mid-October, at the time of sowing. It was a celebration that only married women participated. As long as the Thesmoforia lasted, women abstained from carnal pleasures, fasted and exchanged obscene jokes among themselves, possibly in honor of the jokes of Jabes that made Demeter laugh. The festival was completed with Calligen where women were celebrating. Since the festival of Thesmoforia the names Thesmophore and Kalligenia were attributed to Dimitra.\n\n\n\nDemeter symbols\n\nThe symbols of Demeter were cranes, the ear, the narcissisus, myrtia and the yolk. The bees were considered her priests and in her sacrifices they offered her bulls, calves, and honey.\n\nNames of Demeter\n\nBefore the plowing the farmers sacrificed in Proherasia Demeter, in the harvest in Drepanephoron, in the threshing in Aloada and in spring in Dimitra Chloen. Other names attributed to her are Julo, Aglaucarpos, Sito, Polycarp, Spermia, Cinder and Philopyrus.\n\nApart from the Library of Apollodorus important sources where Demeter is mentioned are the Homeric Hymns that refer to it, Hesiodos with His Theogenia and Pausanias.\n\n\n\nIts name comes from De (dorian type of Eart) and the mother and means mother earth.","html":"<p>Demitra (Demite in arch. el.), in Greek mythology, was the ideal anthropomorphic deity of farming, namely agriculture, but also of free vegetation, soil and fertility, a consequence of which was also considered to be the protector of the marriage and motherhood of people.

Althoug he is not an Olympic god and Homer seems to ignore him, already since the 6th B.C.E., he is represented along with the Olympians, although he appears relatively distant. Sometimes he is depicted sitting right of his father in the Olympian rooms. Dionysus as a mythological entity \"is neither a child nor a man, but an eternal teenager, occupying a place between the two.\" In this form, it represents \"the spirit of the energy and transformative power of the game\" full of cunning, deception and strategies that indicate either the divine wisdom or archetype of the Trickster, present in almost all the mythologies of the world.\n\nIn Greek mythology, Dionysus is born from his father's thigh and delivered to twelve nymphs or water spirits, the Hyades, which become fooders of the divine child. Later, as a token of gratitude for their service, the Hyades were elevated to the heavenly firmament where they shine as a constellation of the Pleiades. He is a Pyrigenic, and a Lake, inherently bringing the quality of the 'port or marsh'.

Ekabi is best known as the wife of the king of Troy Priam during the Trojan War and the mother of Hector.\n\n\n\nOrigin\n\nAccording to other sources (the genealogy of Ekhabi became much involved with ancient novelists), Ekabi was the daughter of the king of Thracians Kissea and Teleklea, or the river god Sangari and the nymph Evagori. But also as Dimada's daughter he is again descended from Sangarius. It has also been referred to as the daughter of Glaucippe, Straight or Front. The Thracian origin of Ekabi is preferred by the tragic poets, especially Euripides (but Virgil in Aeneida, VII 320), while the Phrygian origin comes from Iliad. In fact, Roman emperor Tiberius, as he was, often brought philologists into a difficult position by asking them about the genealogy of Ecabis.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren\n\nEkabi has been a faithful wife and a loving mother, famous as many children: In addition to Hector, he had 18 other children, all with Priam. Euripides progresses further and 19 increases it to the unbelievable 50. Apollodorus lists the following 14 (4 daughters and 10 sons):\n\n\n\nHector (he was the firstborn)\n\nParis (alias Alexander)\n\nCream\n\nLaodicea\n\nCassandra\n\nPolyxene\n\nDeiphobe\n\nHelen\n\nAmmon\n\nCitizen\n\nAdios\n\nKnight\n\nPolydorus\n\nTroilos\n\nAs the fifteenth child of Ekab, Polydamas is mentioned.\n\n\n\nAccording to a tradition (\"Cypriot epic\"), Ekabi had a strange dream just before giving birth to Parry: that from her breasts a lit torch was thrown out that set fire all over Troy, even in the forests of Mount Ide. The fortune - tellers she consulted told her that the child she was giving birth would destroy the city. Ekabe, despite this interpretation and relevant advice, did not agree to kill the newborn, but merely to be abandoned to the shepherds of Ede. Paris grew up and later found out what his homeland was and returned to Troy. Another variation of the myth states that fortune tellers, and especially Aishacus (son of Priam from his first wife, Arisbe) notified Priam that a particular day would be born a child that would cause the destruction of Troy. On the prescribed day two children were born: Paris and Munippus, the son of Killa and Thymoti, brother or sister of Priamus. Priamos killed Munippo and Killa.\n\n\n\nThe disaster\n\nIn Homer Ekabi does not play an important role and is rather a shadowy person. She co-hosts and sympathizes with her children and brides. But from the epic circles and then Ekabi grows in importance. Especially in tragics he is represented as a hero full of greatness, who has reached the extremes of misery.\n\n\n\nParry's myth was created to be attributed to Ekabe the shame of Troy's destruction, either because he gave birth to Parry, or because he did not want to kill him. This is the only way to justify the calamities that find Ekabe. At the time Troy was raised, Ekabe had already lost almost all her sons. One, Polydorus, was entrusted by Primius to the king of the Polymistore Peninsula by giving him a lot of gold for Polydorus, so that at least one of their descendants could be saved. But after Troy's fall and Priam's death, Polymester killed Polydorus to familiarize himself with his treasures and threw his body into the sea.\n\nAfter the fall Ekabi was given prisoner of Ulysses. One day, on the shores of Troada, Polydorus' body washed up. Then the tragic mother decided to avenge: He invited Polymist to ask him supposedly where a treasure is hidden. Polymester went and Ekabe at the right time blinded him. Her servants blinded both his children who accompanied their father.\n\nThe Greeks decided to stone Ekabe. As to her death there are variations, but they all share the transformation into a dog. Euripides in his tragedy of the same name says that Ekabe, after first seeing all her children dead or snatched, was transformed by the gods, who felt sorry for her, into a dog. One variant says that Ekabe was transformed into a dog when she was pursued for revenge by Polymistor's companions. Third version is that Ekabi transformed into a dog on the ship that led her slave to Greece. Finally, in the version of stoning, Ekabi was actually stoned by the Greeks, but when they went to pull her under the stones they found, instead of her body, a dog with fiery eyes. Looks like Ekabe was worshiped like a sacred animal goddess by the dog.\n\nThe \"Monument Cage\"\n\nOn the peninsula of Gallipoli, at the height between the cities of Abydos and Dardanos, near the river Rodio was a monument known as the \"Ekavi monument\", \"Cynos signal\" or \"Kynosimas\", and considered it a tomb of Ekabi.\n\nAlso, the asteroid 108 Hecuba (108 Hecuba), discovered on 2 April 1869, was named after the Queen of Troy.\n\nReferences to classical literature\n\nIn addition to Euripides' tragedy of the same name, Ekabi appears as a person in the Troads of the same poet. It also refers to Dante's \"Hell\" (XX 13-20) being insane when she sees her children Polyxene and Polydorus dead. It is also reported by Shakespeare to Hamlet (Act 2, scene 2) and by Kant in \"Critic of pure speech\".","html":"<p>In Greek mythology Ekabi was the daughter of the king of the Dimanta Frigs and the nymph Ebony.

They are also known as Eumenides, thus giving their name to the third tragedy of the Orestea trilogy of Aeschylus. In this particular tragedy, they haunt Orestes, son of Agamemnon and Klytemnestra, for the murder of his mother.\n\nIt is said according to Hesiod that the Furies were born of the blood of Heaven, in order to avenge his own castration from his own son Saturn, and against Aeschylus that these were daughters of the Night and according to the Sophocle daughters of the Eart and the Darkness, while other opinions follow. Their number is not accurate, Homer knows no number of them, Aeschylus introduces a whole dance of Erins, instead Euripides in a drama mentions three, with names given later like Virgil who also recognizes three:\n\n\n\nAlekto (anthropomorphism of rage and fury),\n\nthe Great (anthropomorphism of hatred and envy) and\n\nTisifone.\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nThe heads of the Furies were wrapped with snakes, an image reminiscent of Medusa Gorgo, and in general their whole appearance was horrifying and repellent. They are usually portrayed with a gleaming look black on the face, breathing destructive fire but also with wings bearing black stakes. Their residence had the underworld of Hades from where they assumed the execution of the sentences placed by the judges of Hades and the Trial on humans, even beyond their tomb for this on the murderers were called deities \"'Secutors of the Trial'\". In their hands they usually brought lit torches to disperse the slags that favored or covered the pervasive crimes as well as snake whip as a weapon against the perpetrators. In the middle they were brought zone giving the appearance of Menades and that is why they were also called \"\"Hades Bacches\"\". Action\n\nOne of the most well-known pursuits of the Furies is that against the mother-slayer Orestes who came to Athens was tried by the Areopagos as a murderer having counseled the god Apollo, while the goddess Athena presiding over the judges.

It is often related to the goddess Venus. Love, as Sophocles argues in Antigone, was invincible. According to legend, when he struck with his arrows two people, they fell madly in love.\n\nOrigin:\n\nAccording to Orphic teaching, Love came from the 'world egg' left by Night in the Erebus. Hesiod is also in favor of a cosmogenic origin in Theogonia, as he says that Eros came from Chaos along with Gaia, elements also without birther.\n\nWoman and Love:\n\nPost-home mythology presents creators of Love, while often related to the goddess Venus. According to Sappho he is the son of Venus and Heaven, while according to Simonides the Ceium he is the son of Venus and Mars. He is also referred to as a servant and attendant of Venus. Alcaeus reports that Cupid was the son of Iris and Zephyr. In other sources, Eros' father is considered Hephaestus.\n\nOf the tragic, particular importance to the god Eros is attributed by Euripides. Euripides separates the power of Love in two forms: To the one that can lead to virtue and to the one that leads to misery. In a similar way, at Plato's Symposium we locate the 'good' Love (son of Venus Urania) and the 'bad' Love (son of Venus Pandemos)\n\nLove worship:\n\nLove in art:\n\nArchaeologists of our day do not recognize the existence of verified representations of God dating back to the 6th century B.C.E. Two of the first performances of the love god are at the Acropolis Museum in Athens. The first (dated at 580 BC) is in a shell of black-figured skewer, where goddess Venus seems to hold a boy in her hand. The second (dated at 570 BC) is on a black-shaped tile, where Venus holds two boys, Eros and Imerus in a similar manner.\n\nThe first 'autonomous' appearances of the love god in art take place in the 5th century BC. Love appears independent of other deities, in various depictions: sometimes flies, sometimes sleeps, sometimes rides a dolphin, sometimes holds a flower. Reflecting the myth that wants him as a companion and servant of Venus, in many performances of that period Eros is depicted as helping his mother or other women: to carry for them clothes or towels, to help them in their hairstyle and grooming, to solve or tie the straps of their sandals.\n\nAs early as the 4th century B.C.E., Eros is also included in the Bacchian cycle, i.e. appears in depictions as a faithful follower of the god Dionysus. This tradition continues throughout the Hellenistic Period.\n\nA separate piece in the various depictions of Eros discovered hold the works found in Pompeii, Italy. Among the works that stand out are those of \"the sale of Love\", the punishment of Love and Love as a carrier of the weapons of the god Mars. Special beauty is also considered the sculptures of the time that represent God.\n\nPompeii:\n\nIn the later Hellenistic and Roman years, Eros is often identified with Mourning or Deat. He appears to be holding a torch, usually facing the ground. It is a depiction that finds its roots in the relationship of God with the Bacchian cycle. In the same period they begin their appearance of representations of Eros, in which evidence of his victory in the dispute with Hercules is shown: a wreath or the bat of the semi-god.","html":"<p>According to Greek mythology, Eros was the winged god of love.

The second (dated at 570 BC) is on a black-shaped tile, where Venus holds two boys, Eros and Imerus in a similar manner.</p><p>The first 'autonomous' appearances of the love god in art take place in the 5th century BC. Love appears independent of other deities, in various depictions: sometimes flies, sometimes sleeps, sometimes rides a dolphin, sometimes holds a flower. Reflecting the myth she wants her companion and servant <a href=\"entry:16\" class=\"xref\">Venus</a> In many performances of that period, Eros is depicted as helping his mother or other women: carrying clothes or towels for them, helping them in their hairstyle and grooming, solving or tying their sandals.</p><p>As early as the 4th century B.C.E., Eros is also included in the Bacchian cycle, i.e. appears in depictions as a faithful follower of the god Dionysus. This tradition continues throughout the Hellenistic Period.</p><p>A separate piece in the various depictions of Eros discovered hold the works found in Pompeii, Italy. Among the works that stand out are those of \"the sale of Love\", the punishment of Love and Love as a carrier of the weapons of the god Mars.

Many believe Apollo became the Olympian “solar god”, but this theory is based mainly on assumptions. The Sun's counterpart in Roman mythology is Saul.\n\nGreek mythology\n\nThe best known story in which the Sun is involved is that of the son of Faethon, who was killed driving the solar chariot.\n\nThe Sun was sometimes referred to with the adjective Sun Panoptis (the one who sees everything).\n\nThe Sun was worshiped throughout the Peloponnese, and especially in Rhodes (the island was believed to have been hauled from the sea by the Sun), where gymnastic championships were held every year in his honor. The Colossus of Rhodes was dedicated to him.\n\nThe Sun was often portrayed as a haloized young man in a chariot, wearing a cloak and with an globe and a camouflage. The roosters and eagles were connected to the Sun.\n\nSun\n\nIn Odyssey Ulysses and his surviving crew arrive on an island, dedicated to the sun god, which Circe calls Hyperion instead of Sun. There were the sacred Red Vodia of the Sun. Despite Ulysses’ warnings, the men of the wicked killed and ate some of them. The guards of the island, daughters of the Sun, told their father and he destroyed their ship and all men except Ulysses.\n\nThe Sun's counterpart in Roman mythology was Saul. He was worshipped as Sol Indiges.\n\nThe Emperor Heliogavalus introduced Saul Invictus from Syria, “the invincible Sun”.\n\nSun and Apollo\n\nApollo as presented to Homer, with a silver (and not gold) arc has no solar characteristics. But by the Hellenistic times Apollo had been closely associated with the sun religiously. Foivos' last name was later attributed by Latin poets and to the god Sun Sol.\n\nThe oldest references to Apollo as identified sometimes with the sun god appear in the surviving excerpts of Euripides Faethon's work. Throughout the work the Sun seems to be presented as separate from Apollo but in a speech near the end of the project the Klymeni, mother of Phaethon, mourns the loss of her child by the Sun which people rightly call Apollo (the name Apollo here was understood in the meaning of Apollos “Destructor”).\n\nThe identification became commonplace in philosophical texts and appears in the writings of Parmenides, Emetokles, Plutarc and Thebes States among others and also appear in some Orphic texts. Pseudo-Eratosthenes writes about Orpheus:\n\nBut having gone down to Hades for his wife and seeing what kind of things were there, he did not continue to worship Dionysus, from whom he was known, but believed that the Sun is the greatest of the gods, the Sun to which he also addressed as Apollo. Waking up every night around dawn and climbing Mount Pagaion waited for the sunrise to see him first. Therefore, Dionysus, angry with him, sent the Vassarids, as Aeschylus the Tragedy says. He was torn apart and scattered by the members.\n\nDionysus and Asclepius are also sometimes identified with this Apollo Sun.\n\nBut in the mythological texts Apollo and the Sun are almost everywhere separate. The sun god, the son of Hyperion, with his solar chariot, though often called Phoebus is not called Apollo except deliberate non-traditional identifications. Roman poets often referred to the sun god as Titan.","html":"<p>In early Greek mythology the Sun was personified as a deity, which Homer corresponds to the solar Titan Hyperion.

At the time, according to one tradition, Eos asked Zeus and turned him into tetiga (tziqi), otherwise Heos kidnapped him in Ethiopia where he had two sons Imathion (with playful traditions in Thessaly and Macedonia) and Polyphilitos Memnona, the enclave hero of ancient myths and the main hero of the \"Ethiopeida\" epic of Arctinus.</p><p>The third love companion of Heus was the beautiful hunter Orion whom he also kidnapped from Tanagra and who however deprived him very quickly. By transmitting to him her incurable love passion she was thrown by the arrows of goddess Artemis on the island of Ortygia, either because she dared to challenge her in a discus throw race, or by the ignorance of the goddess while he swam, in his motivation <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> a (because he bore heavily his love affair with his sister), or for another reason.

However, Alkimede is also referred to as his mother. Jason was a descendant of the god Aeolus. Aesonas, the legitimate king of Iolkou, was expelled from his half-brother, Pelias, while another version says that Aesonas trusted Pelias with power until Jason became an adult. Little Jason was raised in Pelion by Centaur Chiron, who also taught him medicine.\n\nAs soon as he was of age, Jason took the road to Iolko. On the road, as he attempted to pass a river, he lost his one sandal, so he appeared in his hometown \"monosandal\". He wore the skin of a panther and held a lance in each hand. Upon arriving in the center of Iolkou Pelias saw him, who at the time was performing a sacrifice. Pelias was then horrified, because an oracle had told him to \"save off the monosandal\". Jason stayed 5 days at his father's house and then went to Pelias and asked him for power. As soon as Pelias recovered from his fear, he asked Jason what punishment he would impose on a crown usurper, so Jason responded to him that he would send him to bring the \"Golden Fleece\", the sheep of the feathered ram who had fled Frixos and Ellie. Pelias then ordered Jason to perform this mission, but another tradition states that Jason himself made the decision to go and bring Deras: according to the poets, goddess Hera imposed this idea on him, with the ultimate goal of punishing Pelias for not honoring her as she would like.\n\nAt the Argonaut Campaign\n\nOnce the decision was made, Jason found Argos, the son of Frixus, and asked for his help. Argos then, on the advice of goddess Athena, built \"Argo\". Then Jason had a preacher turn around Greece and announces the upcoming campaign to come and join anyone who would like. This campaign became known, by the name of the ship, as \"Argonautic\", and the heroes involved as \"Argonauts\", articles to which we refer.\n\nAfter passing through Limnos, Samothrace, Kyziko (where by a tragic misunderstanding Jason killed the king of the same name), Mysia, the countries of the Vebrics and Mariandynes, and after ridding Phineas of the Arpyans, the Argonauts reached Kolchis. There Jason was presented before King Eite, to whom Frixos had donated the Golden Fleece, and explained to him the purpose of his mission. Eite, who had dedicated the Deras to the god Mars, said that he had no objection, as long as Jason lived two bulls with bronze legs that were burning out of their nostrils (these two bulls, the gift of Hephaestus to Aeitis, had never been fed before), plowed with them a field and sown it with the teeth of a dragon.\n\nJason began planning how to accomplish these feats when Medea, the witch daughter of Aetis entered his life. Medea fell in love with Jason once she saw him, and knowing the problem she wanted to help him. But he asked him to promise to take her with him to Greece and marry her. Jason promised her and Medea gave him a liquid, with which he smeared his body and his shield. From that moment on he couldn't hurt him, not even the fire. Only the power of the magic fluid ceased after 24 hours. Medea also revealed to Jason that, as she would sow the dragon's teeth, they would grow proudly armed warriors, who would seek to kill him. Jason was thus able to live the bulls without burning out of their flames, and threw a stone among the warriors who \"spired\", as Medea had also advised him, so they thought that one of them threw her and killed each other.\n\nAfter Jason accomplished these two feats, Aet broke his promise. He even tried to burn the ship and eliminate the Argonauts. There was nothing left but for Jason to be able to get the Fleece by himself. But it was guarded by a dragon who never slept. Again Medea acted and with her magic she revealed the monster, so Jason approached, took the Golden Fleece from the tree where it was hung and took it with him. The Eagle was so sure of the dragon that he did not show the necessary attention. So the Argonauts managed to sail along with Deras, Medea, but also the brother of Medea, the Apsyrtos. The Aeite pursued him with a ship, but Medea massacred the Apsyrtos, torn him apart and threw the pieces at sea one by one, so Aetis lost much time to collect the pieces of his son and the Argonauts escaped.\n\nAfter additional adventures (as Zeus was angry about the crime and sent them constantly tricks), and after facing Talos in Crete, they were in danger in the Cretan Sea. Jason begged Apollo to show them the way. In fact, the god of light obeyed the prayer of the hero and sent them a light beam which led them to one of the Sporades, from where they then found their way to Iolko.\n\nJason and Medea\n\nJason, having taken Medea as his wife, handed Pelias the Golden Fleece. From this point on, various traditions and versions were created. According to one, Jason took the reign, but according to another he was so exhausted that he simply lived quietly in his city and had a son, Medeus, with Medea. But after a while he wanted to avenge his uncle Pelias for what he had done to his father (he had killed him by forcing him to drink bull blood). Then Medea, assuming to satisfy Jason's vindictive fury, conceived, as a witch, this evil scheme: in front of Pelia's daughters he slaughtered a ram and after cutting it pieces he then changed it by magic into a living lamb, thus showing that it can be brought back in the same way to the youth of every old organism, even man. The stupid daughters then slaughtered the old Pelia in anticipation of his conversion to new, but Pelias no longer returned to life. After these the son of Pelia, Acastos, acted immediately, succeeding Pelia on the throne of Iolkou, and drove Medea out of the city with Jason. The couple found shelter in Corint.\n\nIn Corint Jason and Medea lived quietly for at least 10 years. But over time Jason began to get bored of Medea and began to see the beautiful and much younger daughter of Corinthian King Creon, Glaucy or Creusa. She finally got engaged. Medea then realized that she was in a difficult position, as she was staying in a foreign place, and with her way back closed, as her crime with Afsyrtos would be paid hard in Colchis. So he tried to convince Jason to remain faithful to her, reminding him of the vows of faith he had given her and calling on the gods themselves as witnesses. But these proved to be in vain, so Medea again manifested herself as a witch: He sent as a wedding present to Glaucy a wedding tunic, which just wore him he caught fire and burned her alive. So did her father, Creon, trying to help her. For Jason, Medea reserved the harshest revenge: He killed their two children. Since then her name has become a synonym for the mother who kills her children. Probably Jason would have suffered worse if, apparently, he was not still a hope for Medea. Jason faced her angry, so Medea went up to the skies on a magical chariot sent to her by the sun god and disappeared from the face of the earth.\n\nJason began after these wanting to forget Corint and what he reminded him of and to think about Iolko, where the usurper's son, Acastos, still reigned. In one version, with the help of Peleus, who had precedents with Acasto and his wife, and the Dioscuri, Jason conquered Iolko. Then Peleus killed Acasto and his wife Police.

This campaign became known, by the name of the ship, as \"Argonautic\", and the heroes involved as \"Argonauts\", articles to which we refer.</p><p>After passing through Limnos, Samothrace, Kyziko (where by a tragic misunderstanding Jason killed the king of the same name), Mysia, the countries of the Vebrics and Mariandynes, and after ridding Phineas of the Arpyans, the Argonauts reached Kolchis. There Jason was presented before King Eite, to whom Frixos had donated the Golden Fleece, and explained to him the purpose of his mission. Eite, who had dedicated the Deras to the god Mars, said that he had no objection, as long as Jason lived two bulls with bronze legs that were burning out of their nostrils (these two bulls, the gift of Hephaestus to Aeitis, had never been fed before), plowed with them a field and sown it with the teeth of a dragon.</p><p>Jason began planning how to accomplish these feats when Jason entered his life.<a href=\"entry:158\" class=\"xref\">Medea</a>, the witch daughter of Haiti. Medea fell in love with Jason once she saw him, and knowing the problem she wanted to help him. But he asked him to promise to take her with him to Greece and marry her. Jason promised her and Medea gave him a liquid, with which he smeared his body and his shield. From that moment on he couldn't hurt him, not even the fire. Only the power of the magic fluid ceased after 24 hours. Medea also revealed to Jason that, as she would sow the dragon's teeth, they would grow proudly armed warriors, who would seek to kill him. Jason was thus able to live the bulls without burning out of their flames, and threw a stone among the warriors who \"spired\", as Medea had also advised him, so they thought that one of them threw her and killed each other.</p><p>After Jason accomplished these two feats, Aet broke his promise. He even tried to burn the ship and eliminate the Argonauts. There was nothing left but for Jason to be able to get the Fleece by himself. But it was guarded by a dragon who never slept. However, the Commission has not yet taken any action.<a href=\"entry:158\" class=\"xref\">Medea</a> And with her spells she revealed the monster, so Jason approached, took the Golden Fleece from the tree where he was hanged and took it with him. The Eagle was so sure of the dragon that he did not show the necessary attention. So the Argonauts managed to sail along with Deras, Medea, but also the brother of Medea, the Apsyrtos. The Aeite pursued him with a ship, but Medea massacred the Apsyrtos, torn him apart and threw the pieces at sea one by one, so Aetis lost much time to collect the pieces of his son and the Argonauts escaped.</p><p>After additional adventures (as Zeus was angry about the crime and sent them constantly tricks), and after facing Talos in Crete, they were in danger in the Cretan Sea. Jason begged him <a href=\"entry:12\" class=\"xref\">Apollo</a> to show them the way. In fact, the god of light obeyed the prayer of the hero and sent them a light beam which led them to one of the Sporades, from where they then found their way to Iolko.</p><p>Jason and <a href=\"entry:158\" class=\"xref\">Medea</a></p><p>Jason, having taken as his wife <a href=\"entry:158\" class=\"xref\">Medea</a>, handed Pelias the Golden Fleece. From this point on, various traditions and versions were created. According to one, Jason took the reign, but according to another he was so exhausted that he simply lived quietly in his city and had a son, Medeus, with Medea. But after a while he wanted to avenge his uncle Pelias for what he had done to his father (he had killed him by forcing him to drink bull blood). Then Medea, assuming to satisfy Jason's vindictive fury, conceived, as a witch, this evil scheme: in front of Pelia's daughters he slaughtered a ram and after cutting it pieces he then changed it by magic into a living lamb, thus showing that it can be brought back in the same way to the youth of every old organism, even man. The stupid daughters then slaughtered the old Pelia in anticipation of his conversion to new, but Pelias no longer returned to life. After these the son of Pelia, Acastos, acted immediately, succeeding Pelia on the throne of Iolkou, and drove Medea out of the city with Jason. The couple found shelter in Corint.</p><p>In Corint Jason and the <a href=\"entry:158\" class=\"xref\">Medea</a> They lived quietly for at least 10 years. But over time Jason began to get bored of Medea and began to see the beautiful and much younger daughter of Corinthian King Creon, <a href=\"entry:49\" class=\"xref\">Glaucus</a> Or Creuse. She finally got engaged. Medea then realized that she was in a difficult position, as she was staying in a foreign place, and with her way back closed, as her crime with Afsyrtos would be paid hard in Colchis. So he tried to convince Jason to remain faithful to her, reminding him of the vows of faith he had given her and calling on the gods themselves as witnesses. But these proved to be in vain, so Medea again manifested herself as a witch: He sent as a wedding present to Glaucy a wedding tunic, which just wore him he caught fire and burned her alive. So did her father, Creon, trying to help her. For Jason, Medea reserved the harshest revenge: He killed their two children. Since then her name has become a synonym for the mother who kills her children. Probably Jason would have suffered worse if, apparently, he was not still a hope for Medea. Jason faced her angry, so Medea went up to the skies on a magical chariot sent to her by the sun god and disappeared from the face of the earth.</p><p>Jason began after these wanting to forget Corint and what he reminded him of and to think about Iolko, where the usurper's son, Acastos, still reigned. In one version, with the help of Peleus, who had precedents with Acasto and his wife, and the Dioscuri, Jason conquered Iolko. Then Peleus killed Acasto and his wife Police. Jason is also reported to have taken part in the hunt for Calydon Capros.</p>"},{"id":113,"name":"Iaso (Ιασώ)","description":"Iasso is an ancient Greek, ideal, anthropomorphic, secondary (despite Asclepius) deity intertwined with the \"sacred\" concept of Iasi (herapy).

Her father was the sun god and her mother Persian, one of the oceans. Circe was the sister of Aetis and Pasiphae.\n\nCirce lived on the island on which she was queen, Aaia, and transformed her enemies or those who offended her into animals using magic drinks, as she knew much about their herbs and medicinal effects.\n\nCirce is better known than the Odyssey of Homer, where it is described to live in a mansion in the middle of a clearing, in a dense forest, and weave in a huge loom. According to Ulysses himself, there were lions and wolves around, poisoned victims of her magic, who were not dangerous to those visiting the place. There Ulysses and his companions arrived during their wandering. The first of those who visited her, Circe invited to a meal with food in which she had cast some of her magic filters. After eating, she touched them with her magic stick and transformed them into pigs. Only Euryloc, who suspected her from the beginning, escaped and notified Ulysses and the others who had stayed on their ships. Ulysses began saving Circe's victims. On the way Mercury caught up with him and told him to buy the molly herb so he wouldn't have the same luck. So it happened. After Circe's magic failed, the witch was so surprised to fall in love with Ulysses and agree to give his companions the human form again. Ulysses and his companions then remained on her island for a year and then instructed them how to return home, describing them two different marches.\n\nUlysses in the palace of Circe\n\nTowards the end of the work of Theogonia (1011f), Hesiod writes that Circe gave birth to three children from Ulysses: Wild, Latino and Telegonus.

In later myths, Circe allegedly transformed Picco into a woodpecker because she refused her love and Scylla to a monster when Glaucus, whom Circe loved, declared his immortal love for Scylla.\n\nIn addition, Circe allegedly had a daughter named Aiga.\n\nModern interpretations\n\nHistorians of Medicine have assumed that the transformation of Ulysses partners into pigs is a metaphor for the effect of anticholinergic alkaloids, such as scopolamine and atropine, acting as acetylcholine inhibitors on the nervous system. Symptoms from taking such substances include amnesia and hallucinations. The description for the mole fits the milk flower plant, producing secondary metabolites that can act as an antidote to anticholinergic drugs.\n\nCirce, Bertram McKennal\n\nAsteroid 34 Circe (34 Circe), discovered in 1855, was named after Circe, while as \"Cirque\" is also known as a variant of chess.","html":"<p>In ancient Greek mythology, Circe was a secondary deity, otherwise witch or nymph.

According to the dominant version (Iliad) he was the son of Atreus and Aerope, grandson of Pelopa and Hippodameia. According to another, later version, Menelaus and Agamemnon were sons of Plissthenus and grandsons of Atreas, but they were raised by their grandfather. On one occasion they were expelled from Mycenae and fled to Sparta, where Tyndareus was king. Contestant there with other suitors, Menelaus took as wife Beautiful Helen, daughter of Tyndareo. So after the death of the Dioscourus, Tyndareus gave his kingdom to Menelaus and Helen.\n\nFrom the marriage of Menelaus and Helen were born Hermione and Nicostratus. Later writers say that their children were also: Ethiopian, Throne, Moraffius, Plissthenes the Younger and Melitis. The peace of the couple was upset since Paris arrived in Sparta and especially when Menelaus left Crete to attend the funeral of his grandfather Katreos. According to some tradition, Menelaus had once visited Troy, after a brotherly oration, to sacrifice in the tombs of Wolf and Himireos (sons of Prometheus) for the pestilence and drought that plagued Sparta. There he had been hosted by Parry, so when Paris later left Troy after a murder, he fled to Sparta, where he was hosted and purified by Menelaus.\n\nIn the Trojan War\n\nWhile in Crete, Menelaus was informed by Iris that Paris had grabbed Beautiful Helen and left. Then he immediately returned to Sparta and asked for the help of other kings of Greece, with Nestor first. Then he went to Delphi for directions. There he was ordered to offer \"Athena Welfare\" the necklace that Venus once offered to Helen. The campaign of Greeks in Troy for Beautiful Helen followed, leading to the Trojan War.\n\nMenelaus himself took part in the campaign with sixty ships, but did not become its general leader because of his mild character, so the leadership passed to his violent brother, Agamemnon.\n\nOnce the Greeks landed in Troy, Menelaus and Ulysses went first to the city to seek back Helen, but also the treasures Paris had seized from Menelaus Palace, so that the difference could be settled peacefully. They were welcomed by Andesoras and presented them at the Trojan convention. But Paris, on his side, refused their proposals. Menelaus dueled with Parry and seriously wounded him, but he was also slightly injured by Pandarus.\n\nIn the many and cruel battles of the Trojan War the Skamandrios, Pisandros, Hypernoras, Dolopas and Thomas found death at the hands of Menelaus, while Helen was wounded. Menelaus also came out first in the battle for the body of Patroclus and killed Euforbos. Menelaus took part in the burial games in memory of Patroclus.\n\nMenelaus was one of those who hid inside the Trojan Horse. In the fall of Troy he ran to the house of Deifovos, where Helen was located, killed Deiphobus and dragged Helen from hair to Greek ships. But according to another tradition, Helen resorted to the home altar and, while Menelaus originally wanted to kill her, finally reconciled with her with the help of the gods.\n\nThe Return from Troy\n\nReturning from Troy after the end of the war, Menelaus arrived at Sounio and then Cape Maleas. But a storm there lured him to Crete, on a rocky coast of which most of his ships were destroyed. After Crete it was found in Egypt, where during the Odyssey, it remained 5 years and made a fortune. He always wished to return to Sparta, but was constantly prevented by bad times, which ceased only when he sacrificed to the gods on the advice of the Proteus. Then Menelaos and Helen arrived well in Sparta, 18 years after the abduction of Helen by Parry.\n\nAfter the end of his life Menelaus was transferred to the Elysian Fields. Later on, Menelaus and Helen went to Tauric to search for Orestes and there they were sacrificed by Iphigenia on the altar of Artemis. Pausanias says that in his time the house of Menelaus was still being saved in Sparta. There was a temple in honor of Menelaus in Therapne, where according to local tradition he was buried with his wife.\n\nThe asteroid 1647 Menelaus (1647 Menelaus) of the Trojan Group was thus named by the mythical Greek king.","html":"<p>In Greek mythology Menelaus was the brother of Agamemnon and wife of Beautiful Helen.

The campaign of Greeks in Troy for Beautiful Helen followed, leading to the Trojan War.</p><p>Menelaus himself took part in the campaign with sixty ships, but did not become its general leader because of his mild character, so the leadership passed to his violent brother, Agamemnon.</p><p>Once the Greeks landed in Troy, Menelaus and <a href=\"entry:180\" class=\"xref\">Ulysses</a> They went to town first to ask for Helen back, but also the treasures that had been seized by <a href=\"entry:192\" class=\"xref\">Paris</a> from Menelaus Palace, so that the difference can be settled peacefully. They were welcomed by Andesoras and presented them at the Trojan convention. But Paris, on his side, refused their proposals. Menelaus dueled with Parry and seriously wounded him, but he was also slightly injured by Pandarus.</p><p>In the many and cruel battles of the Trojan War the Skamandrios, Pisandros, Hypernoras, Dolopas and Thomas found death at the hands of Menelaus, while Helen was wounded. Menelaus also came out first in the battle for the body of Patroclus and killed Euforbos. Menelaus took part in the burial games in memory of Patroclus.</p><p>Menelaus was one of those who hid inside the Trojan Horse. In the fall of Troy he ran to the house of Deifovos, where Helen was located, killed Deiphobus and dragged Helen from hair to Greek ships. But according to another tradition, Helen resorted to the home altar and, while Menelaus originally wanted to kill her, finally reconciled with her with the help of the gods.</p><p>The Return from Troy</p><p>Returning from Troy after the end of the war, Menelaus arrived at Sounio and then Cape Maleas. But a storm there lured him to Crete, on a rocky coast of which most of his ships were destroyed. After Crete it was found in Egypt, where in <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a> He remained five years and made a fortune. He always wished to return to Sparta, but was constantly prevented by bad times, which ceased only when he sacrificed to the gods on the advice of the Proteus. Then Menelaos and Helen arrived well in Sparta, 18 years after the abduction of Helen by Parry.</p><p>After the end of his life Menelaus was transferred to <a href=\"entry:98\" class=\"xref\">Elysee Fields</a>. Later on, Menelaus and Helen went to Tauric to search for Orestes and there they were sacrificed by her <a href=\"entry:118\" class=\"xref\">Iphigenia</a> At the altar of Artemis. Pausanias says that in his time the house of Menelaus was still being saved in Sparta.

Others, again, considered them river daughters: either the largest river there was, the Ocean, or Acheloos, or the daughters of the local rivers of a place. Thus, each area had its rivers and each of them had given birth to the Nymphs of this region, e.g. the Pinios River was the father of the Nymphs of Thessaly and the Xanthos River was the father of the Nymphs of Troy. Very often they gave their names to nearby cities, as was the case with Nymp Sparta, who was the daughter of the Eurota River. But there were some Nymphs, which were called Melas and were born from the drops of Heaven's blood, which fell to Eart when Saturn, his son, cut off his genitals.\n\n\n\nThey were primarily freshwater spirits and were in the rivers, springs and mountains from which rivers went. They always accompanied the water, thus stressing its great importance for life. Without it, no vegetation, no fertility. So through the life - giving power of water the Nymphs spread to the mountains and forests and became associated with vegetation. That is why they are considered daughters of the Ocean or other rivers.\n\n\n\nSo the Nymphs ended up being three kinds: 1) Naiades, i.e. Nymphs of rivers, springs and fountains and are the most famous, 2) Orestiades, residing in the mountains where there are springs and 3) Dryades or Amadsades, i.e. Nymphs of the lonely trees and meadows and identified with Meles. The Naiads lived in caves, located near water or within it, beneath the surface of the rivers. Within their caves they enjoyed the joys of love with Mercury or the Silenes. They lived as much as the sources, near which they lived: when those were deprived, the Naiads were extinguished. The same was true of the Amads—their name means \"tree and woman at the same time\"—the pines, fir trees and oaks began to grow as soon as the life of a Nymp began. They were trees strong and lived for many years, while mortals were forbidden to touch them with an axe.\n\n\n\nThe reason was that they were considered sacred trees and the sacred groves formed were places dedicated to the gods. When Nymp’s time came to die, her tree first withered on earth. Once a Nymp, where she danced with her likes, paled by observing her oak moving around. He left the dance full of concern; very quickly broke the skin, fell the branches and at the same time the soul of the Bride flew, saying goodbye to the light of the Sun. The Nymphs, when it rains, rejoice because they feed the trees, or weep when the oaks lose their leaves.\n\n\n\nFor Naiades, in particular, there are many myths about their love adventures. They said that once Ylas, Hercules' companion, approached a source to fill his water supply. There they used to gather the Nymphs and sing hymns in Artemis overnight. Ylas had arrived just as the Nymphs began to gather and one of them, Efydatia, who lived in the spring, raised her head and faced him. He was dazzled by his divine beauty and fell in love with him. He, bent down, had plunged his water hydrant without suspecting that someone was watching him carefully. Nymp wanted to seize the opportunity and kiss him; she hugged him by the neck and pulled him with her to the bottom. His comrades searched for him, but they could not in any way explain his disappearance. Very well known also were the stories of the nymphs’ lovers with shepherds, who usually grazed their sheep on the river banks. Then the Nymphs brought to the world sons of mortals, but wise and brave.\n\n\n\nEqually famous were the stories about Apollo's love with Nymphs and particularly Daphne's story. God besieged her with great perseverance, without success. Once he was given the right opportunity, he started chasing her. The moment he was about to grab her, Daphne desperately begged her mother Gaia to help her. Then, really, the earth opened and swallowed Daphne, while in her place a plant named after her grew.\n\n\n\nAnother Nymp, Aucroe, daughter of a river of Samos, attempted to leave with a boat from the island, to escape God's hands. But he was trying in vain, because Apollo transformed the boatman who carried her to a fish and her boat into a rock.\n\n\n\nAccording to tradition, the Nymphs were known feeders of many and important gods or heroes; that is, they were those who undertook their upbringing, when they were at a very early age. They were fed and made up of the replacements of their mothers. First, Zeus himself was raised from them in Crete. Here are Hera, Persephone, Mercury, Panas and Dionysus. Since then the Nymphs have been members of the Dionysian troupe, along with the Satyrs. Moreover, the goddess Venus had trusted Aeneas, her son, in the Nymphs of the Trojan mountain Ide. In Naiads they attributed various qualities: they said they could make the waters of a source of healing, so mortal sacrifices were often offered in their honor. The most famous cases of Naiads with similar abilities were in the Peloponnese and Sicily; there, in the hot springs of Imera, they said Hercules was going to renew his power.\n\n\n\nThey also believed that the Naiads had medical healing abilities, mainly because of their relationship with Apollo, as well as the gift to prophesy the things to come. In fact, there was a perception that they knew how to interpret the will of higher deity; I love Pana's wishes or Daphne's of Gaia. In the cave Seal of Mount Kithaironas there was a oracle of the Brides, while many mortals, endowed with divination abilities, said that their abilities had been received from them. They were also considered mothers of many wise mortals, mantes, and doctors, such as Hariklo of Tiresia, Philura of Chiron, and Koronida, mother of Asclepius. Nymphs were worshipped in many places throughout Greece, but there were no temples dedicated to them. The sacrifices in their honor were made near sources or in caves. Odysseus and the inhabitants of Ithaca honored them with a hundredth, or a hundred oxen sacrifice. Often there was the existence of their altars within sacred other gods. But the Nymphs did not always act beneficial to mortals and there were times when they caused great evil. If, for example, one happened to see a Bride while taking her bath in the spring, she lost her senses. But they were generally able to confuse the minds of mortals and make them mad. The people occupied by ecstasy and enthusiasm, fled their homes and went to the mountains, where they hid in caves.\n\n\n\nThe Nymphs have survived our folk tradition to this day; They are our well-known fairies, who live in the mountains, the fairies and the fairies. It is always considered dangerous to meet them, since there are still the myths about \"the fairy-bearers\", such as Ylas in ancient times. Only the Saturday-born and \"alafroiskiots\" can perceive them and watch them dance. In conclusion, it is worth highlighting once again that the Nymphs were worshiped as elements of the springs and rivers, that is, in general water. The importance of water as a force of life and fertility is great and vital in a Mediterranean country, such as Greece. Water is a source of life and helps growth and revitalizes every living organism. That is why the perception of the Nymphs has expanded even further: they have come to regard them as spirits of vegetation, thus wanting to symbolize in general the orgastic power of nature. And as water feeds everything, Nymphs were considered food for plants, animals and humans.","html":"<p>The Nymphs were female forms of divine origin, young in age, living in the wild, circling the mountains, accompanying Artemis and playing with her.

He is widely known for his cunning and ingenuity, and famous for the ten years his return home took him, after the Trojan War as allegorically attributed to him by Homer. He was the son of Laertis and Anticleia, wife of Penelope and father of Telemachus.\n\nThe genealogical tree of Ulysses, one of Agamemnon's best lieutenants and hero distinguished as few in Iliad, remains dark and difficult to understand. Laertis' father (or stepfather) is Arkesius, the son of Kefalos (known founder of Kefalonia), and grandson of Aeolus. In Euripides' tragedy, the mythical Sisyphus is referred to as his father, and is believed to have had a son with Circe, Telegonus.\n\nIthaca was one of the many islands included in the kingdom of Odysses, among the Ionian islands of Ancient Greece. His kingdom seems to have had a small stronghold in mainland Greece, near the Acheloos River. The exact elements and boundaries of the kingdom are not known, as the information provided by Homer is unclear.\n\nThe name Ulysses has several versions: Olysses, Ulises, Ulixes, in Latin he is known as Ulysses while in Roman mythology he has the name Ulixes.\n\nThe name \"Odysseus\", derived from the verb \"\"dyss\" (i'm angry, hate someone) and means outraged, but also the hater of the gods, the one who gave him grounds for discontent, is believed to have been given by his grandfather (on his mother's side), Autolycus. This version is based on the fact that Ulysses hates Gods and the Gods hate Ulysses.\n\nAccording to Homer the name means \"son of stone\", but more likely it is related etymologically to the word \"driver\". It can also mean \"\"pain\" in the sense of \"\"he who causes and feels pain\"\"—it is not accidental that he feels a lasting pain spiritual and/or physical—that is, causing pain to someone else and at the same time another to him.\n\nUlysses is sometimes attributed the paternal noun Laertiades, i.e. \"Son of Laertis\".\n\n\n\nLittle is known about Ulysses' childhood and teen years. From the few references to Odyssey we learn about the hunting of the car at Autolycus' house, Parnassos. On this hunt Ulysses was injured and obtained a scar above the knee (sign sufficient for his servant, Circular, to recognize him when he returned to Ithaca). At another point we learn about his journey to Messini and his acquaintance with Iphitos, the son of Euryclea, who gave him the heavy bow with which he later murdered the suitors.\n\nUlysses was one of Helen's prospective suitors, daughter of Tyndareo. However, in fear of insulting the powerful and famous suitors who had gathered, Tyndareus delayed the selection process. Then Ulysses, who had promised to solve the problem, suggested that all suitors swear to support and help whoever Helen chose for her husband. The suitors, including Ulysses, took the oath and so Helen chose Menelaus, the most powerful of them.\n\nTwo versions exist for Ulysses' marriage to Penelope. The first version, described by Homer, wants Ulysses to defeat his rivals in a race announced by Ikarios, the father of Penelope. According to the second version, Ulysses for his help to Tyndareus at Helen's wedding, took in exchange his brother's daughter, Icarius.\n\nWhen Helen was kidnapped by Paris of Troy (a fact that caused the Trojan war), the suitors were invited to honor their oath and help Menelaus get Helen back. According to Homer, Ulysses knew from an oracle that he would return after 20 years and that is why he did not want to participate in the campaign. To get rid of the conscription he pretended to be crazy, but his fraud became perceived and revealed by Palamedes and since then Ulysses devoted himself to the success of the campaign. To others, Menelaus' brother, Agamemnon, visited Ulysses in Ithaca and after a great deal of effort persuaded him to participate in the Trojan campaign.\n\nWit Ulysses now a member of the expeditionary body, Agamemnon turned to Achilles (who was not Helen's suitor), because it had been said that Troy would not fall without him. Ulysses was sent to Skyros, Lycomedes Court, to ensure Achilles' participation. But Achilles' mother, Goddess Thetis, transformed him into a woman, so that he could not participate in the war. Thetis was led to this act by the prophecy that her son would either live a long and dull life or die young by achieving eternal glory, and feared the consequences of leaving for the Trojan campaign. Ulysses unable to locate Achilles asked, before returning, to be allowed to give gifts to the women of the court. He took out some gold as well as a sword, a pole and a shield. All women were interested in jewelry except one, whose interest was drawn by military equipment. Ulysses suspected the fraud and marked a war trumpet, with the hearing of which the \"woman\" instinctively grabbed the weapons. \"She\" finally turned out to be Achilles and so Ulysses with his cunning managed to discover him. Then Thetis allowed Achilles to fight, after first giving him the armor of his father, Peleus, who had been forged by God Hephaestus himself, to protect him in battle.\n\nJust before the war began, Ulysses along with Menelaus formed a diplomatic mission to bring Helen back peacefully. And while Menelaus' arguments were emotional and unconvincing, Ulysses almost persuaded the Trojan senate to return Helen, but eventually failed.\n\nUlysses was one of the main Achaean heroes in the Trojan War. The others were \"the divine\" Achilles, \"the \"archontic\" Agamemnon, Menelaus, the wise Nestor, Aiadan the Telamony and Diomedes.\n\nIn Iliad Ulysses is presented by the hostage as a valiant warrior, wise king and resourceful leader. His view on many issues is adopted by the other leaders as everyone respected him. After all, the Nestor trinity, Odysseus and Idomeneus were recognized as the most reliable advisors. During the war Odysseus emerged as a reconciliation and uniting force among the Greeks. He tries to reconcile Achilles with Agamemnon, after the dispute over Brissida, and turns Agamemnon when disappointed by military defeats he thinks to leave Troy. He still manages to contain the raging Achilles when after Patrocle's death he wants to attack the Trojans immediately and unprepared.\n\nHis bravery and martial ability are often praised by Homer in Iliad, but more in his night campaigns. Wit Diomedes they managed to enter Troy and steal the palladium, while at another time they went to the Thracian camp, killed many of them in their sleep and stole their king's horses. During the funeral games in honour of Patroclus he managed with Athena's help to win in the race. He then defeated Ajada the Telamonium (in the funeral games in honor of Achilles) by winning the armor of the dead Achilles and causing Ajada's suicide with the sword Hector had given him.\n\nUlysses' most catalytic contribution to the Trojan War, however, was inspired by the Trojan horse. This wooden structure, a sample of strategic intelligence, was constructed by Epeius according to Ulysses' instructions. When completed, Ulysses drove inside the Knight dozens of Achaeans and waited for their \"throwers\" Trojans to be patiently waited. The Trojans, after believing that the Achaeans abandoned the coast of Troy and left them as a gift to the Trojan horse, led him inside the city and began wild feasts. Wit the fall of the night, however, the hidden inside the Knight Achaeans, extorted and managed to take over the unprotected city relatively easily. That also meant the end of the Trojan War.\n\nWhen the city of Troy was conquered by the Achaeans, after ten years of war, many of the winners carried out extremes. They killed many civilians, women and children, but also captive soldiers. They even killed those seeking asylum within the sacred temples of the gods. The few survivors, women mostly, were transported to the ships to be used as slaves after returning home to each one. At the end of Iliad the total plunder, destruction and levelling of the city is mentioned, they did not leave even the sacred temples of the gods standing.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Odysseus, like everyone else, took the way back to Ithaca. For the insults against the gods he committed in Troy (hyvres) he was punished (nemesis), ten years of wandering before reaching Ithaca. Initially, for Ulysses, the gods had not decided on such a great punishment but when Ulysses blinded Polyphemus, he angered Poseidon, who vowed never to let him return to Ithaca. All adventures and wanderings are detailed by Homer in the Odyssey.\n\nStarting in Troy, Ulysses had 12 ships on board by his Ithacian comrades. Their wanderings begin with the sailing and battle in the country of the Kikones, the adventure in the country of the Lotofagons and then in the country of Cyclops, where they were trapped in the cave of Polyphemus and Ulysses blinded him, attaching Poseidon's sin. Then they arrived on the island of Aeolus, where the God of the same name handed him a bottle containing all the winds except the favorable ones, to return immediately to Ithaca. Approaching Ithaca, however, Odysseus' comrades open to the sack, causing a storm that destroys 11 ships and drags this of Odysseus to the island of Laistrigans. From there they go to Circe Island, a witch who transformed many of the crew into animals. A year later, and after having gone down to Hades to meet Tyresia, leaving the island of Circe, they pass through the strait of the Sirens, the strait of Bitc and Harybdi and arrive decimated on the island of God Sun.\n\nOn the island of the Sun, his remaining companions find death and he drifting by the waves arrives alone on the island of Calypso. Calypso stays for 7 years before leaving on a raft and, after the storm that Poseidon causes, ends up on the island of Phaeaks. There he is thought up by Nausicaa and finds refuge in the Court of King Alkinoos, where he eventually reveals his true identity and thrills all with the narrative of his wanderings (point where Odyssey begins). Wit the help of Alkinoos and after a new storm Odysseus finally manages, after 10 years, to reach Ithaca.\n\nAt times, many writers were inspired by the history of Ulysses and modified it less or more. The classical Greek writers who dealt with Ulysses (Euripides, Pindar and Sophocles) respected him for his cunning and intelligence and presented him as an honest warrior and king. The Roman writers were divided, as some criticized him (Virgilius, Statius) and some honored him (Viatius, Ovid). Even later writers who dealt with him are Calderon, Dante, Giovanni Pascoli, Tennyson, Nikos Kazantzakis and James Joyce.\n\nAs a rule, in the post-homeric epics Ulysses is presented as a scheming character that has no virtues and moral barriers. In the play \"\"Cyprus epics\" he is said to have played the crazy, plowing and sowing his fields with salt instead of seeds, in order not to take part in the campaign. When Palamedes even revealed the truth by forcing him to campaign, Ulysses killed him with the help of Diomedes. In \"Little Iliad\" again, Odysseus tries to murder Diomedes to familiarize himself with glory from the theft of the palladium, while later he kills Hector's little son, Constable. It is also said that Ulysses was the one who planned the coming of Iphigenia, under the pretext of marrying Achilles, to be sacrificed for having no heavenly wind.","html":"<p>Odysseus, the mythical king of Ithaca, is the main hero in Homer's epic poem, <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a>, and also plays a decisive role in the other epic of Homer, <a href=\"entry:115\" class=\"xref\">Iliad</a>. He is widely known for his cunning and ingenuity, and famous for the ten years his return home took him, after the Trojan War as allegorically attributed to him by Homer. He was the son of Laertis and Anticleia, her husband <a href=\"entry:200\" class=\"xref\">Penelope</a> and the father of Telemachus.</p><p>The genealogical tree of Odysseus, one of Agamemnon's best lieutenants and hero distinguished as few in <a href=\"entry:115\" class=\"xref\">Iliad</a>, remains dark and difficult.

To the tragedy \"\"<a href=\"entry:118\" class=\"xref\">Iphigenia</a>\"Euripides, the mythical <a href=\"entry:214\" class=\"xref\">Sisyphus</a> is referred to as his father, and is believed to have had a son with her <a href=\"entry:133\" class=\"xref\">Circe</a>, Telegonus.</p><p>Ithaca was one of the many islands included in the kingdom of Odysses, among the Ionian islands of Ancient Greece. His kingdom seems to have had a small stronghold in mainland Greece, near the Acheloos River. The exact elements and boundaries of the kingdom are not known, as the information provided by Homer is unclear.</p><p>The name Ulysses has several versions: Olysses, Ulises, Ulixes, in Latin he is known as Ulysses while in Roman mythology he has the name Ulixes.</p><p>The name \"Odysseus\", derived from the verb \"\"dyss\" (i'm angry, hate someone) and means outraged, but also the hater of the gods, the one who gave him grounds for discontent, is believed to have been given by his grandfather (on his mother's side), Autolycus. This version is based on the fact that Ulysses hates Gods and the Gods hate Ulysses.</p><p>According to Homer the name means \"son of stone\", but more likely it is related etymologically to the word \"driver\". It can also mean \"\"pain\" in the sense of \"\"he who causes and feels pain\"\"—it is not accidental that he feels a lasting pain spiritual and/or physical—that is, causing pain to someone else and at the same time another to him.</p><p>Ulysses is sometimes attributed the paternal noun Laertiades, i.e. \"Son of Laertis\".</p><p>Little is known about Ulysses' childhood and teen years. Of the few references to <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a> We learn about the hunting of the car at Autolycus' house in Parnassos. On this hunt Ulysses was injured and obtained a scar above the knee (sign sufficient for his servant, Circular, to recognize him when he returned to Ithaca). At another point we learn about his journey to <a href=\"entry:157\" class=\"xref\">Messin</a> and his acquaintance with Iphitos, son of Euryclea, who gave him the heavy bow with which he later murdered the suitors.</p><p>Ulysses was one of Helen's prospective suitors, daughter of Tyndareo. However, in fear of insulting the powerful and famous suitors who had gathered, Tyndareus delayed the selection process. Then Ulysses, who had promised to solve the problem, suggested that all suitors swear to support and help whoever Helen chose for her husband. The suitors, including Ulysses, took the oath and so Helen chose Menelaus, the most powerful of them.</p><p>Two versions exist for Ulysses' marriage to <a href=\"entry:200\" class=\"xref\">Penelope</a>. The first version, described by Homer, wants Ulysses to defeat his rivals in a race announced by Ikarios, the father of Penelope. According to the second version, Ulysses for his help to Tyndareus at Helen's wedding, took in exchange his brother's daughter, Icarius.</p><p>When Helen was kidnapped by Paris of Troy (a fact that caused the Trojan war), the suitors were invited to honor their oath and help Menelaus get Helen back. According to Homer, Ulysses knew from an oracle that he would return after 20 years and that is why he did not want to participate in the campaign. To get rid of the conscription he pretended to be crazy, but his fraud became perceived and revealed by Palamedes and since then Ulysses devoted himself to the success of the campaign. Others, Menelaus' brother, <a href=\"entry:5\" class=\"xref\">Agamemnon</a>, visited Ulysses in Ithaca and after a great deal of effort persuaded him to participate in the Trojan campaign.</p><p>Wit Ulysses now a member of the expeditionary corps, <a href=\"entry:5\" class=\"xref\">Agamemnon</a> He turned to Achilles (who was not Helen's fiancé), because it had been said that Troy would not fall without him. Ulysses was sent to Skyros, Lycomedes Court, to ensure Achilles' participation. But Achilles' mother, Goddess Thetis, transformed him into a woman, so that he could not participate in the war. Thetis was led to this act by the prophecy that her son would either live a long and dull life or die young by achieving eternal glory, and feared the consequences of leaving for the Trojan campaign. Ulysses unable to locate Achilles asked, before returning, to be allowed to give gifts to the women of the court. He took out some gold as well as a sword, a pole and a shield. All women were interested in jewelry except one, whose interest was drawn by military equipment. Ulysses suspected the fraud and marked a war trumpet, with the hearing of which the \"woman\" instinctively grabbed the weapons. \"She\" turned out to be <a href=\"entry:17\" class=\"xref\">Achilles</a> And so Ulysses with his cunning managed to discover him. Then Thetis allowed Achilles to fight, after first giving him the armor of his father, Peleus, who had been forged by God Hephaestus himself, to protect him in battle.</p><p>Just before the war began, Ulysses along with Menelaus formed a diplomatic mission to bring Helen back peacefully. And while Menelaus' arguments were emotional and unconvincing, Ulysses almost persuaded the Trojan senate to return Helen, but eventually failed.</p><p>Ulysses was one of the main Achaean heroes in the Trojan War. The others were \"the divine\"<a href=\"entry:17\" class=\"xref\">Achilles</a>, \"the boss\"<a href=\"entry:5\" class=\"xref\">Agamemnon</a>, the <a href=\"entry:156\" class=\"xref\">Menelaus</a>, the wise <a href=\"entry:172\" class=\"xref\">Nestor</a>, Aiantas the Telamonian and <a href=\"entry:65\" class=\"xref\">Diomede</a>.</p><p>InIliad Ulysses is presented by the hostage as a valiant warrior, wise king and resourceful leader. His view on many issues is adopted by the other leaders as everyone respected him. After all, the triad <a href=\"entry:172\" class=\"xref\">Nestor</a>, Ulysses and Idomeneas were recognized as the most reliable advisors.

He still manages to contain the raging Achilles when after Patrocle's death he wants to attack the Trojans immediately and unprepared.</p><p>His bravery and warship are praised many times by Homer in Iliad But more in his night campaigns. Wit Diomedes they managed to enter Troy and steal the palladium, while at another time they went to the Thracian camp, killed many of them in their sleep and stole their king's horses.

This wooden structure, a sample of strategic intelligence, was constructed by Epeius according to Ulysses' instructions. When completed, Ulysses drove inside the Knight dozens of Achaeans and waited for their \"throwers\" Trojans to be patiently waited. The Trojans, after believing that the Achaeans abandoned the coast of Troy and left them as a gift to the Trojan horse, led him inside the city and began wild feasts. Wit the fall of the night, however, the hidden inside the Knight Achaeans, extorted and managed to take over the unprotected city relatively easily. That also meant the end of the Trojan War.</p><p>When the city of Troy was conquered by the Achaeans, after ten years of war, many of the winners carried out extremes. They killed many civilians, women and children, but also captive soldiers. They even killed those seeking asylum within the sacred temples of the gods. The few survivors, women mostly, were transported to the ships to be used as slaves after returning home to each one. At the end of Iliad The total looting, destruction and leveling of the city are reported, they did not leave even the sacred temples of the gods standing.</p><p>After the end of the war, Odysseus, like everyone else, took the way back to Ithaca. For the insults against the gods he committed in Troy (hyvres) he was punished (nemesis), ten years of wandering before reaching Ithaca. Initially, for Ulysses, the gods had not decided on such a great punishment but when Ulysses blinded Polyphemus, he angered Poseidon, who vowed never to let him return to Ithaca. All adventures and wanderings are detailed by Homer in <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a>.</p><p>Starting in Troy, Ulysses had 12 ships on board by his Ithacian comrades. Their wanderings begin with the sailing and battle in the country of the Kikones, the adventure in the country of the Lotofagons and then in the country of Cyclops, where they were trapped in the cave of Polyphemus and Ulysses blinded him, attaching Poseidon's sin. Then they arrived on the island of Aeolus, where the God of the same name handed him a bottle containing all the winds except the favorable ones, to return immediately to Ithaca.

Althoug both epics are attributed by tradition to Homer, literature recognizes significant differences between them and the prevailing view is that Odyssey was composed by a different poet, with some time distance from Iliad. Odyssey deals with the adventurous sensation (repatriation) of the hero of the Trojan War and king of Ithaca Odysses and the murder of the suitors, who had occupied his palace and claimed Penelope's wife.\n\n\n\nOdyssey was divided by the Alexandrian Grammars into 24 rhapsodes, numbered with the small letters of the Greek alphabet. By groups the rapsods co-extend Telemachia (a-d), where we see Odysseus Telemachus' son seeking his father, Phaakida (z-n), where we hear the hero himself narrating to the Phaeaks his previous adventures and reaching Ithaca, and Mnestirafonia (x-o), the story of the punishment of the suitors. The Odyssey mainly talks about the taste of Odysseus and his return home, Ithaca, as well as his search for his son, Telemachus. Odyssey also named one of his works Nikos Kazantzakis, which is attended by 33,333 verses and should not be confused with another work by him about Odyssey which is no more than the translation of Homer's epic into Modern Greek.\n\nSummary of Odyssey:\n\nRhapsody a:\n\nThe poet invites Musa to tell us the story of Ulysses. Poseidon, who adversates the hero, misses the Ethiopians and the gods meet in Olympus. At Athena's initiative they decide to route his taste.\n\nIn application of the divine plan, Athena descends to Ithaca to motivate Telemachus to seek out his father. In the form of Mendi, a fatherly friend, he enters the palace, where suitors party by unscathedly wasting foreign property. Telemachus warmly welcomes the stranger, and Athena tries to convince him that his father lives. It prompts him to denounce the conduct of the suitors and go to the kings of Pylos and Sparta to ask about Ulysses.\n\nBy leaving Athena is revealed and Telemachus revives. Oedus Femios sings the return of the Achaeans from Troy, but Penelope descends aching and invites him to change his song. Telemachus speaks strictly to her and sends her back to her quarters. He then confidently turns to the suitors, tells them to leave his home and announces that he will bring the matter to the Ithaca assembly. An argument follows. As the first day of the poetic year of Odyssey ends, Telemachus wakes up and reflects on Athena's suggestions.\n\nRhapsody b:\n\nOn the morning of the second day Telemachus convenes the assembly, exposes the situation, urges suitors to leave, and threatens them with divine punishment for their unholy works. The suitors blame Penelope, who avoids marriage with cunning, and calls on Telemachus to impose on her. He says he can't get his mother out of the house, but he accepts to marry her again if he's given a boat to look for his father and make sure he's finally dead. Two eagles scratching each other are interpreted by the fortune teller Alithosis as a sign for the short return of Ulysses and punishment of suitors. The suitors swear and threaten the seer, and so do Mentor, an old friend of Ulysses, who criticizes the apathy of the Ithacans. Fiancé Leocritos states that even if Ulysses returns, they will kill him, and destroy the assembly.\n\nTelemachus descends to the beach and begs Athena to support him. Athena appears in the form of Mentora, reassures him, instructs him and offers to help him. Telemachus returns to the palace and, despite the irony of the suitors, begins the preparations. Circular, his nanny, is concerned, but eventually he vows not to tell his mother anything. Athena/Medor finds a boat and sailors, sleeps the suitors and announces to Telemachus that everything is ready. The journey begins and continues all night in the favorable wind sent by the goddess. The travelers offer her a vertebrae.\n\nRhapsody c:\n\nAt the dawn of the 3rd day of Odyssey Telemachus and Athena/Mentor arrive at the beach of Pylos and find the people to be a sacrifice to Poseidon. King Nestor and his sons welcome them to the gathering. Nestor remembers Ulysses and the suffering of the Achaeans with emotion and describes their discord upon leaving Troy. He and Menelao sailed in a hurry to prevent the wrath of the gods, while Ulysses and others were left behind to offer sacrifices first. It lists the Achaeans who learned that they reached their homelands, but for Ulysses knows nothing more. As for the situation in Ithaca, it prompts Telemachus to confront the suitors with Athena's help. Telemachus' pessimistic response causes Athena/Medora's reaction.\n\n\n\nTelemachus changes the subject and asks the king more details about the murder of Agamemnon. Nestor tells how Aegisthus stole his wife, killed him when he returned and usurped the throne of the Mycenaeans. Menelaus' brother was unable to help because he was also lured by the sea riot in Crete and Egypt. But his son Orestes took the revenge he had to. When it gets dark, Nestor does not let his strangers stay on board but Athena/Mentor departs revealing her divine identity. Nestor impressed with her promises sacrifice and all return to the palace for sleep, including Telemachus, who receives special treatments.\n\n\n\nThe next day, the 4th of the Odyssey, Nestor offers a magnificent sacrifice with a golden-horned ox to Athena and then the meal prepares cars and supplies for Telemachus' journey. Accompanied by Nestor's son Pisistrato Telemachus departs for Sparta. They spend the night in Fries and the next day they go on.\n\nRhapsody d:\n\nOn the morning of the 5th day they arrive in Sparta and find Menelao on the double wedding of his children. They enjoy generous reception and are dazzled by the wealth of the palace. Menelaus speaks with pain of Agamemnon and Ulysses causing Telemachus' tears. Helen recognizes him first and her husband is thrilled to have such a guest. Everyone mourns for those who lost.\n\nHelen pours in the wine a herb that drives away pain. He tells how he once recognized Ulysses when he infiltrated Troy to spy. She didn't turn him in, instead she was happy to see him, since she wanted to go back to Sparta. Menelaus in turn recounts how Ulysses spared the Achaeans who were hidden in the Trojan Horse, when they were in danger of being revealed.\n\nThe next day, the 6th of Odyssey, Telemachus asks about his father and describes the situation in Ithaca. Menelaus wishes the death of the suitors and tells of his blockade in Egypt. There he tamed the terrible old man of the sea Protea and advised him to make a sacrifice to Zeus. Among others he told him that Ulysses is alive and trapped on the island of Calypso. Finally, Menelaus invites Telemachus to stay longer in Sparta, but he kindly refuses.\n\nIn Ithaca the suitors are surprised to know Telemachus' journey and decide to kill him with deceit. Penelope is learning the news and she's afraid of losing her son now. She prays to Athena and she brings to her sleep her sister Iphlimi, who reassures her with the assurance that Telemachus is under the protection of the goddess. Meanwhile, the suitors sail a boat and ambush the straits of Sami.\n\nRhapsody e:\n\nOn the morning of the 7th day the gods meet again in Olympus. Zeus sends Mercury to Ogygia with the command to Calypso to leave Ulysses now. She accuses them of envying her for falling in love with a mortal, but eventually retreats out of fear of Zeus' wrath. For the first time, we see Ulysses, crying on the shore, watching the sea, when his bride announces the good news and her promise to help him. He swears to believe her, but warns him that his suffering is not over. After lunch they spend their last night together.\n\nOver the next four days Ulysses builds a raft with the tools of Calypso and the fifth day (12th of Odyssey) begins. Calypso gives him supplies, instructions and the wind to travel. After seventeen days, at dawn on the eighteenth (29th), the coasts of Schiria, the country of Phaeaks, air on the horizon. But as Poseidon returns from the Ethiopians he sees Ulysses and angry he raises terrible sea trouble. The raft dissolves and Ulysses struggles with waves on a beam. The goddess Leukothei sympathizes with him and gives him a lifesaver handkerchief. He lives it, throws his clothes and jumps into the sea. Poseidon leaves with joyous satisfaction, so Athena intervenes and appeases the storm somewhat.\n\nTwo more days Odysseus sails, until the third (31st) he manages with Athena's help to approach the coast of Schiria and reach the mouth of a river. He prays on the river to save him and the river accepts him. Ulysses, naked and impoverished, goes ashore and flees to a forest where he sleeps hidden in the bushes.\n\nRhapsody g:\n\nWhile Ulysses sleeps, Athena goes to the city of Phaeaks and appears in the dream of Nausica, the daughter of King Alkinow, taking the form of a friend. Reminds her she's married and urges her to go down to the river to wash her clothes. The next morning (32nd day) Nausica asks her father for a car and with her friends they go down the river. After washing the clothes, they bathe, eat and play with the place by shouting and singing.\n\nUlysses wakes up confused and wonders where he is. He decides to come out of the bushes hiding like-like his nakedness. The girls are scattered horribly, except for Nausica, encouraged by Athena. Keeping distance Ulysses praises the beauty of the daughter and wishes her a happy marriage. He describes his condition and begs her to show him the way to the city and give him a rag to cover. Nausica recognizes the kindness of its impoverished face and assures him that it is welcome in this country. She calls her friends to get scared and take care of him.\n\nUlysses out of respect for young girls bathes aside and Athena surrounds him with divine beauty. In the midst of Nasica, he wishes that the man who will marry her should be the same. He invites Ulysses to the palace, so as not to be mischaracterized, but instructs him to follow her as the grove of Athena, outside the city. After staying there for a while until she gets home herself, he asks to be shown the palace of Alkinow and there to fall begging on the queen's knees. Nausica begins, her friends and Ulysses follow. At dusk they reach the grove and Ulysses prays to Athena for the Phaeakes to welcome him.\n\nRhapsody\n\nNausica reaches the palace and Ulysses starts from the grove for the city. Athena appears on his way in the form of a young girl and shows him the way by covering him in fog to avoid facing problems with locals. He talks to him about the Phaeaks and Queen Aretis and advises him to address her first.\n\nUlysses arrives in the palace and does not believe in his eyes: gold, silver and copper everywhere, weaving, multitude of slaves, and a paradise orchard. Inside they eat and drink the lords of the Pheasants. He approaches Areti and then the fog that dug him disappears. Bewildered the patrons see the stranger fall begging at the queen's feet begging to send him home. After the first embarrassment, Alkinos offers his hospitality and invites the rulers of the Phaeaks to organize an official reception for the stranger the next day, in case he is a god. Ulysses assures that he is not a god and repeats his request.\n\nThe rest of the whales are leaving. Areti recognizes the clothes the stranger wears and asks him who he is and how he got there. Ulysses briefly recounts his shipwreck, his seven-year stay in Calypso, his turbulent journey to Schiria and his meeting with Nausica, but does not reveal his identity. Alkinus criticizes his daughter, who did not accompany the stranger to the palace, and wishes to make him his son-in-law. But he promises that the Phaeakes will lead him home if he prefers it. The day ends with the afflicted Ulysses going to sleep enjoying the care of the service staff.\n\nRhapsody\n\nThe next morning (33rd day of Odyssey) the rulers of the Phaeaks gather at the convention and Alkinos presents his stranger, asks for a boat to be prepared and calls them all for the reception table at the palace. The palace is full of people and the Oedus Demodocus arrives. After eating he sings about an altercation of Ulysses with Achilles in Troy. Ulysses, who listens without revealing his identity, is moved, but hides his tears. To entertain his grief Alkinos invites the Phaeak boys to sports games.\n\nEveryone goes back to the market and young people compete in sports. In the end they also invite Ulysses to fight, as he still seems young and strong. Ulysses initially refuses, but when Euryalos causes him contentively, he gets angry, catches the heavier album and throws it away from everyone else. He turns to the speechless Phaeakes and reveals that he was first of all in the war of Troy. Alkinos responds by extolating the virtues of his people in navigation, entertainment, and entertainment.\n\nThe tension relaxes and the dance begins. In the middle Demodocus sings the sceptical song of the crippled Hephaestus, who caught in his conjugal bed the beautiful Venus with Mars and denounced them to the gods, but they mocked him. Two sons of Alkinoo perform impressive dance figures, which challenge Ulysses' praiseful comments. Alkinos senses that the stranger is no longer a random man and suggests that the rulers of the Pheacons give him precious gifts. Euryalos gives his sword and his apology to the stranger.\n\nAt dusk the gifts of the rest of the lords arrive and all return to the palace. After the bath Ulysses meets Nausica, who admires him. \"Remember me. You owe your life to me first,\" he says. He promises to honor her as a goddess when he arrives home. The feast begins and Demodocus catches the lyre. Ulysses praises him and asks him to sing for the Trojan horse. For the second time he hears his exploits praise in Troy and drowns in tears. Alkinoos interrupts the oyster and starts the questions: who is he, to what country should the Phaeak ship lead him to, in what lands did he wander? And still, why does he cry every time he hears about Troy? The time of truth has come","html":"<p>Odyssey is the second great epic of the ancient Greek secretariat after <a href=\"entry:115\" class=\"xref\">Iliad</a>.

Some ancient writers attribute to him an entire epic cycle, which includes further poems about the Trojan war as well as the Theban poems about Oedipus and his sons. Tradition says Homer was blind and various Ionian cities are considered to be his place of birth, but his biography is unsolved. Repeatedly the question has been raised whether it was the author of Iliad and Odyssey himself as well as Vatrachumyofighting, while Homerian hymns and circular poems are generally considered to be later than the two epic poems.\n\nTradition wants Homer blind, various areas of Ionia claim his place of birth, however we do not know accurate biographical evidence about his face.\n\nHomer (750 - 650 BC) Homer is recognized as the creator of epic poetry of Western civilization, although there is no clear information about his face. Legends say he was touring as a tailor in Ionic courts of officials, and some information says he was blind. Seven ancient cities claimed the honorary title to be Homer's hometown. Homer's main works are considered the two, \"homeric\" so-called epics, Ilias and Odyssey, which are the oldest epics of European literature. But other works of the time, such as a parody of Iliad, the Vatrachumyomachia, are attributed to Homer.\n\nIlias consists of about 16,000 lyrics and refers to the last fifty-one (51), decisive days of Troy's war, which overall lasted, according to legend, 10 years. The Odyssey consists of about 12,000 verses and describes the also 10-year journeys of the king of Ithaca, Odyssey, during the transition from Troy who had been raised, to his homeland. However, linguistic and cultural studies show that the two epics should not have been written by the same author. Specifically, the first, Ilias, is attributed to Homer, who probably joined together and worked out earlier small epics. The second, Odyssey, is attributed to another, unknown writer, about a generation younger than Homer, who may have elaborated and improved a pre-existing smaller epic.\n\nThe hostage issue:\n\nGenerally, there is agreement among scholars that Iliad and Odyssey were subjected to a process of standardisation and removal of the oldest material in the 8th century BC. An important role in this process was played by the Athenian tyrant Hipparc, who reformed the recitation of Homeric poetry in the Panathenes. Many classicists argue that this reform must have included producing a normal written text.\n\nAn analysis of the structure and vocabulary of Iliad and Odyssey shows that poems consist of normal repeated phrases even whole lyrics. Could Iliad and Odyssey be oral traditions, composed on the spot by the poet who uses a collection of memorized lyrics and phases? Milman Parry and Lord Albert pointed out that such a edited oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of epic poetry in a purely oral culture. Just when these oral poems took a stable written form is under discussion. The traditional answer is the \"transliteration case\", where a non-literation \"\"Homer\" dictates his poem to a 6th-century literate scribe BC or earlier. More radical Homerists, such as Gregory Nagy, argue that a regular text of the Homeric poems as a \"document\" did not exist until the Hellenistic period.\n\nOther scholars, however, retain their faith in the theory of a true Homer... Thus, little is known or even assumed about his real life, and a well-known joke says that poems \"were not written by Homer, but by another person of the same name,\" and classical scholar Richmond Lattimore, author of a good poetic translation into Englis of both epics, wrote the thesis \"\"Homer: Who was it?\". Samuel Butler was more specific, theorizing that a young woman from Sicily was an editor of the Odyssey (but not the Iliad), an idea extended by Robert Graves to \"The Daughter of Homer\".\n\nIn Greek his name also has the literal meaning of the hostage. There is a theory that his name arose from the name of a society of poets, the so-called \"Hamirids\", which means \"the sons of hostages\", i.e. descendants of prisoners of war. Since these individuals were not sent to war because their faith in the battlefield was doubtful, they would not be killed in battles.

Tradition says Homer was blind and various Ionian cities are considered to be his place of birth, but his biography is unsolved. Repeatedly the question has been raised whether it was the author of Iliad and Odyssey himself as well as Vatrachumyofighting, while Homerian hymns and circular poems are generally considered to be later than the two epic poems.</p><p>Tradition wants Homer blind, various areas of Ionia claim his place of birth, however we do not know accurate biographical evidence about his face.</p><p>Homer (750 - 650 BC) Homer is recognized as the creator of epic poetry of Western civilization, although there is no clear information about his face. Legends say he was touring as a tailor in Ionic courts of officials, and some information says he was blind. Seven ancient cities claimed the honorary title to be Homer's hometown. The main works of Homer are considered the two, \"home\" so-called epics, Ilias and <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a>, which are the oldest epics of European literature. But other works of the time, like a parody of Iliad The frog fights are attributed to Homer.</p><p>Ilias consists of about 16,000 lyrics and refers to the last fifty-one (51), decisive days of Troy's war, which overall lasted, according to legend, 10 years. The <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a> It consists of about 12,000 verses and describes the also 10-year wanderings of the king of Ithaca, Odysseas, during the transition from Troy who had been raised, to his homeland. However, linguistic and cultural studies show that the two epics should not have been written by the same author. Specifically, the first, Ilias, is attributed to Homer, who probably joined together and worked out earlier small epics. The second, Odyssey, is attributed to another, unknown writer, about a generation younger than Homer, who may have elaborated and improved a pre-existing smaller epic.</p><p>The hostage issue:</p><p>In general, there is agreement among scholars that <a href=\"entry:115\" class=\"xref\">Iliad</a> and <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a> were subjected to a process of standardisation and removal of the oldest material in the 8th century BC. An important role in this process was played by the Athenian tyrant Hipparc, who reformed the recitation of Homeric poetry in the Panathenes. Many classicists argue that this reform must have included producing a normal written text.</p><p>An analysis of its structure and vocabulary <a href=\"entry:115\" class=\"xref\">Iliad</a> lon <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a> It shows that poems consist of normal repeated phrases and even whole lyrics. Could Iliad and Odyssey be oral traditions, composed on the spot by the poet who uses a collection of memorized lyrics and phases? Milman Parry and Lord Albert pointed out that such a edited oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of epic poetry in a purely oral culture. Just when these oral poems took a stable written form is under discussion. The traditional answer is the \"transliteration case\", where a non-literation \"\"Homer\" dictates his poem to a 6th-century literate scribe BC or earlier. More radical Homerists, such as Gregory Nagy, argue that a regular text of the Homeric poems as a \"document\" did not exist until the Hellenistic period.</p><p>Other scholars, however, retain their faith in the theory of a true Homer... Thus, little is known or even assumed about his real life, and a well-known joke says that poems \"were not written by Homer, but by another person of the same name,\" and classical scholar Richmond Lattimore, author of a good poetic translation into Englis of both epics, wrote the thesis \"\"Homer: Who was it?\". Samuel Butler was more specific, theorizing that a young woman from Sicily was her editor <a href=\"entry:181\" class=\"xref\">Odyssey</a> uth (but not of <a href=\"entry:115\" class=\"xref\">Iliad</a>(v) an idea extended by Robert Graves to \"The Daughter of Homer\".</p><p>In Greek his name also has the literal meaning of the hostage. There is a theory that his name arose from the name of a society of poets, the so-called \"Hamirids\", which means \"the sons of hostages\", i.e. descendants of prisoners of war. Since these individuals were not sent to war because their faith in the battlefield was doubtful, they would not be killed in battles.

Orpheus' mythical figure was a loan from the Thracian neighbors of the Greeks. Thracian Orphic Mysteries, rituals of unknown content, were named after Orpheus.\n\nOpinion:\n\nThe name Orpheus is not found in Homer or Hesiod, but was known at the time of Ibycus (c. 530 BC). Pindar (522-442 BC) refers to him as \"\"the father of songs\"\".\n\nFrom the 6th century BC, Orpheus was considered one of the main poets and musicians of antiquity, and the inventor or the one who perfected the lyre. Wit the power of his music and song, he could charm wild animals, stimulate trees and rocks to dance, even stop river flow. As one of the protagonists of culture, he is considered to have taught humanity the arts of medicine, writing and agriculture. Closely associated with religious life, Orpheus was an omen and seer. He practiced magical arts, especially astrology, founded or made many important mysteries accessible, such as those of Apollo and Thracian god Dionysus. He established rituals, public and private, and dictated initial and cleansing rituals.\n\nEtymology:\n\nMany etymologies have been proposed for the name Orpheus. A possible suggestion is that it comes from a hypothetical First-Indo-European verb *orbhao-, I'm deprived of *orbh-, separating. Relative to them would be the Greek word orphan. Orpheus may therefore be semantically near him, i.e. I mourn, sing wildly, enchant, uniting his seemingly unequal roles as a disappointed lover, transcendent musician and priest of mysteries in a lexicological ensemble. The word orphic is defined as secret, magical and ecstatic, and possibly, because of the Oracle of Orpheus, orphic can also mean divination. According to another etymological version of his name comes from the orphene (= darkness). Intense text\n\nGenealogy:\n\nAccording to the best known tradition, Orpheus was the son of Oiagros, king of Thrace which was seen during the prehistory included an area from the area of Olympus in Pieria to the Straits of Hellispontus as in the Orphic texts (Argonautic) it is reported that Orpheus was born in Mount Elikon in Libithra (Piplan Pieria), and Calliope, Musa of epic poetry. In other traditions, his parents are Calliope and Apollo. Orpheus learned music from Lino, or Apollo, who gave him his lyre as a gift.\n\nArgonaut campaign:\n\nDespite his Thracian origins he participated in the Argonaut campaign, led by Jason, who had been informed by Chiron that only with the help of Orpheus could they pass through the Sirens intact. Sirens resided on three small, rocky islands and sang beautiful songs that enticed sailors towards them. Then they ate the sailors. When Orpheus heard their voices, he took his lyre and played a prettier music, choking theirs.\n\nThe Deat of Eurydice\n\nThe most famous story in which he stars is that of Eurydice's wife. Eurydice is sometimes also known as Agriope. Escaped from the Aristite, he was bitten by a reptile and died. Otherwise, Orpheus played such bad songs and sang so lamentably that all the nymphs and gods cried and advised him. Orpheus descended into the underworld and with his music he softened the heart of Hades and Persephone (the only person who ever succeeded), who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth. But the deal that accompanied the decision was that he had to walk in front of her and not look back until he reached the upper world. In his agony he broke the promise and Eurydice disappeared again from his sight. History in this form belongs to the time of Virgil, who first introduces the name of Aristaeus. Other ancient writers, however, talk about Orpheus' visit to the underworld. According to Plato, his insidious gods ‘ presented an appearance' of Eurydice. Ovid says Eurydice's death was not caused by her escape from Aristostius but by her dance with the Naiads on her wedding day.\n\nThe famous history of Eurydice may be a later addition to Orphic myths. In particular, the name Eurydice (\"the one whose justice extends widely\") reminds of the mysterious titles of Persephone. The myth may come from another legend about Orpheus in which he travels to Tartara and charms the goddess Hecate.\n\nThe story of Orpheus and Eurydice has interesting similarities with the Japanese myth of Izanagi and Izanami.\n\nAfter Eurydice's death, Orpheus renounced the love of women and took only men as his lovers. He's thought to be the one who introduced male love to the Thracians.\n\nDeat of Orpheus:\n\nAccording to a summary of the Late Antiquity of a lost work of Aeschylus, Orpheus at the end of his life despised the worship of all gods except the sun, which he called Apollo. One morning Mount Pangaion was raised (where Dionysus had a oracle) to greet God at sunrise, but was killed by Thracian Mainades for not honoring his former patron, Dionysus. It is important that his death is proportional to the death of Dionysus.\n\nOvid (Transformations XI) also relates that Thracian Mainades, followers of Dionysus, despised by Orpheus, initially threw sticks and stones at him while playing, but his music was so beautiful that even the stones and branches refused to hit him. Angry, the Mainades tore him to pieces during the frenzy of their Bacchian orgy. Medieval traditions have another addition: in Albrecht Durer's design the ribbon high on the tree says: Orfeus der erst puseran (Orpheus, the first sodomite).\n\nHis head and lyre, still singing mournful songs, sailed to Evros as the Mediterranean coast. There, the winds and waves carried them to the Lesbian coast, where the inhabitants buried his head and a temple was constructed in his honor near Antissa. The lyra was transferred to heaven from the Muses, and placed among the stars. The Muses also collected the pieces of his body and buried them under Olympus, where the nightingales sang over his grave. His soul returned to the underworld, where he eventually reunited with his beloved Eurydice.\n\nIn Attica pottery, however, women attacking Orpheus appear to be normal Thraciotesses, who were furious because the songs of the bard had stolen their husbands away from them.\n\nOrphic poems and rituals:\n\nA large number of Greek religious poems in a digital hexameter were attributed to Orpheus, as were similar images such as Muses, Aristeus, Epimenides and Sibyla. Of this vast literature only two examples survive whole: a group of hymns composed somewhere around the 2nd or 3rd century BC, and a Orphic Argonautics composed somewhere between the 4th and 6th centuries BC. Earlier orphic literature, which can be dated until the 6th century BC, survives only in papyrus fragments or references from later writers.\n\nIn addition to its function as a warehouse of mythological data along with the lyrics of Hesiod's Theogeny, orphic poetry was recited in mysterious rituals and cleansing rites. Those who were particularly devoted to these rituals and poems were often vegetarians, abstained from sex and avoided eating eggs, practice that was known as Orphic life.\n\nIn the Divine Comedy Dante sees the shadow of Orpheus along with the numerous other \"righteous pagans\" in Limbo.\n\n\n\nThe story of Orpheus and Eurydice has become a rival for operas and cantatas through the history of western classical music.\n\nOrpheus is presented as a member on the last trip of Odysseus from Ithaca to the Odyssey of Nikos Kazantzakis.","html":"<p>According to the Greek myth, Orpheus was the main representation of singing art and lyra, and was of particular importance in the religious history of Greece.

Pan) is an ancient Greek, ideal, anthropomorphic and secondary deity that was interwoven with the \"freak\" of Nature, (humans and animals) in a two-way relationship of protection.\n\nCombining the human and animal factor Panas was depicted having lower animal limbs \"God Tragedy\" now as patron of breeders, hunters and fishermen with his permanent stay in places of nature (mountains, forests, caves, valleys, ravines, etc.). His worship received maximum growth alongside that of Zeus and the other Olympian gods throughout Greece and beyond. They say he once chased a bride, the beautiful Syringe, the daughter of the river god Ladon, who, to escape him and save himself, asked her father to turn her into a reed. Panas, cutting pieces of reed, made the syringe, his musical instrument and symbol.

Althoug Paris was born before nightfall that day, Priam felt sorry for the child and did not kill him, as did Ekabi, despite the exhortation of the priestess of Apollo, Heropel. However, Priam ordered the chief shepherd of Aglaus to take the child and kill him, but he, unable to find the courage to do so, left it in Mount Ide, hoping he would be lost there. But it was suckled by a bear. Returning to the point after 9 days Aglaus was surprised to find the infant still alive and took it home in a two-story (I took in ancient Greek, from where Pari's name) to raise it as his own child, while he went to Priam the language of a dog as proof of the execution of the order.\n\nParry's royal lineage was betrayed by his special beauty and intelligence: a child still took out a gang of rustlers and returned the animals they had stolen in the herd, thus winning the nickname \"Alexander\" (= patron of men).

Son of Zeus and Danae. His grandfather was Acrosius, king of Argos. Acraeus always wanted to have a successor for his throne. After Danae was born, she tried to have a son again but failed. He decides to go to Pythia and find out if he'll have a boyfriend. His Pythia announces that he will have a grandson from Danae and that he will be killed by him. Returning to Argos in distress, he closes Danae into an underground room to avoid verifying the oracle. Danai only contacted her nanny, while from a window, elevated, she understood the outside environment.\n\n\n\nZeus, fascinated by the beauty of Danae, visits it, through the window, in the form of golden rain. Perseus is born of this union.\n\n\n\nAcricus learning the birth of his grandson, because he could not kill him, decides to close himself in a box (larnaca), Danae and her son. Then he commands that the larnaka be left at sea and that the gods decide its fate. The larnaka is washed up, after a long journey, on the coast of Serifos Island, where the fisherman Diktis finds it. Another testimony was that Diktis fished the box that accommodated Danae and Perseus. Diktis, the brother of the king of the island, Polydekis or Polythetes, hosted at his home the two afflicted persons and made them members of his family. Diktis may have lived in the famous \"Cyclops Cave\", since the larnaka was found on its shores.\n\n\n\nPerseus grew up in Serifos and became a strong lad. Polydecefs has long wanted Danay to be his wife. At first he had the objection of his own brother. But now she had a key obstacle: her son, Perseus. Wanting to get rid of Perseus, he tends to provide a means to his homeland Argos a condition to make a feat, cut off and bring Medusa's head. Another version of the myth is that Polydecakis declares his marriage to Hippodamia and asks every resident of the island for a wedding gift, a horse. Perseus, a fisherman like Diktis, had no horses. In front of the king's haughty style he utters that he will not bring him a horse, but Medusa's head. Polydecakis accepts this commitment and decides to keep Danae in the palace until Perseus fulfills his obligation. Perseus leaves Serifo on a boat to find Mermaid Medusa. On his way he meets the goddess Athena or Mercury, where he is informed that to kill Medusa he must procure:\n\n\n\nthe helmet of Hades, so that invisible can approach his goal\n\nthe magic sack that will put the terrible head\n\nThe winged sandals, because Gorgo - Medusa lived on rock in the middle of the sea.\n\nThe shining shield, from where he would see Medusa's head. Because anyone who saw Medusa in the eyes of a stone. And finally\n\nthe sharp sword or sickle, with which he would cut the hard neck of Gorgos.\n\nAthena gives him the shiny shield and Mercury gives him the feathered sandals. Another source was the helmet of Cynos or Hades, the winged sandals and the magic sack of Nymphs, to which he arrived guided by his gods - protectors. Athena led Perseus to the country of the Transboreans (witness derived from Pindar), where after a sacrifice he made he included the sharp sword and helmet of Kynos.\n\n\n\nThe only thing left was to learn the place of residence of the mortal Mermaid. Once again Athena helps him, tells him the way to the Elders. The Elders were relatives of Gorgens and the only ones who knew their place of residence. They were beings with a repulsive view. Three old women who had a comedy element: because they had an eye (and a tooth), they traded them together. They lived near Hades in the west of the world.\n\n\n\nPerseus approached them invisible and taking advantage of the moment of exchange grabbed their eye. The Elders, knowing about the oracle for Gorgo, with difficulty and under the threat of losing their eye, testify to the hero Medusa's place of residence.\n\n\n\nWhen the hero approached Medusa, invisible and looking at the mirroring of his shield, with Athena's help cut off her head and put it in the backpack. From the cut was born the giant Chrysamoras, with the golden sword, and, from the blood that fell into the Ocean, Pegasus, the winged horse. From another testimony, Horse was born. To avoid pursuing the Medusa brothers, he quickly flew with his winged sandals or rode Pegasus and left the place. On the way back, it passes through Ethiopia. There, on a rock he sees a female figure chained. She approaches and dazzled by her beauty she stops to learn what is happening. He learns the daughter's name is Andromeda. The daughter of King Kefea and Cassiopeia, Cassiopeia, had provoked the wrath of Poseidon, because she boasted that she was prettier than the Nires. Poseidon sent, as punishment, a Dragon and for atonement demanded the sacrifice of Andromeda. Perseus, in love with Kefea's daughter, decides to kill Dragon and take Andromeda with him.

Son of Titan Iapetus and the Asian Ocean or Themidas, or Terrace or Klymen. His brothers were the Iapetides Epithea, Atlas and Menoitius. His name means wise, thoughtful. It is produced by the intention of \"Pro\" and the verb \"Manthano\", where \"a\", in some ancient-ellenic dialects, becomes \"h\"\". During the Titanic battle Prometheus favored Zeus and therefore was not punished like the other Titans. His contribution to the development of mankind was very important. According to Lucianos, Prometheus, with the help of the goddess Athena, creates the first man (Golden Genos) of clay and fire (in others with the water of the hero Panopea of Phocis) and in a form similar to that of the gods. This took place after Titan fighting. According to the Orphics this clay was the soil watered by the blood of the Titans. Referring to the creation of man, Plato carries us the image of a being spherical, distinguished in three genera-male, female and mixed- and had a double set of members and organs. Later Zeus, because he was outraged by their arrogance and feared their power, split them in two. Animals were created at the same time (after titanfighting), but from a mixture of Eart and fire materials. The creation of beings and man took place within the earth. When all of Eart's beings were called to light, Prometheus and Epimetheus were assigned to give each being the characteristics he should have. Epithea persuaded his brother to allow him to take this \"work\" on his own. Thus Epimetheus named and attributed to each being the characteristics he himself wanted, without wisdom and wisdom. When Man’s time came, in the end, he had nothing to give him but a few hairs and claws vulnerable and powerless. From this mistake Prometheus took over the protection of Man. Seeing the plight of mankind and his weakness toward nature decides to give him Fire. So, visiting the workshop of Hephaestus, he places the fire on a hollow reed and secretly gives it to the people. The town of Sikyona, Peloponnese, is referred to as the place where the fire was delivered. He taught people to handle fire, to create tools and taught them the Sciences (which he stole from Athena) and Letters. To save humanity from the wrath of the gods, he taught her to worship them and make sacrifices to them. When people learned to make sacrifices to the gods it was raised a question of which pieces of the animal would belong to the gods and which to the mortals. Then Zeus agreed with Prometheus to give his word that any share he chooses, that is what the gods and the other will take. Thus, according to a testimony in Sicyon, Zeus came down to do the dissembling. But the prometheus artfully put bones in one share and covered them with delicious fat and the other meat that covered it with leather. Zeus chose the one with fat and when he learned the scam it was too late, he had given his word. Angry Zeus asks Hephaestus to make him a Woman. This is how Pandora is created, from land and sea. It was called this because it received many gifts and gifts from the gods. He also took over a box. Finally Mercury led her to Epithea and he, despite his brother's advice not to accept a gift from Zeus, made her his wife. From Pandora's box the sufferings of men, death and hope were poured out. But Prometheus teaches them medicine and herbs. Zeus, wanting to punish the people who became evil and unjust, and Prometheus, finds opportunity to cause a flood. The cause was the sons of Lykaona, descendants of Pelasgos. Visiting Lykaona's sons, disguised as a traveler, he was offered a soup made by the members of their killed brother, the Night. Enraged turns them into wolves and resurrects the Night. He decides to wipe out humanity (Halkin Genus).

Regarding its origin, there are different versions. The most famous, from Apollodorus, says that he was built by the god Hephaestus and gave him to King Minos to guard Crete. He toured Crete three times a year according to the then system of times, while Plato considers him an existing person, brother of Rhodamanthy. Apollonios Rodius reports that it was a gift of Zeus to Europe, which then gave him to the son of Minos. I. Kakrides, based on the fact that Hessia writes that he meant sun (while Talaios is the name of Zeus) in Crete and based on other elements, expresses the view that he was a solar deity later turned into a hero. Talos according to Plato was tasked with overseeing the application of laws in Crete, carrying them with him written on bronze plates. But most sources say he was a vigilant guardian of Crete. He was turning the coast of the island three times a day, and given that the coastline of Crete is about 1,000 km long, Talos must have been about a hundred and fifty kilometers per hour. To others he was winged and this duty was performed by flying. He kept at a distance the unknown ships approaching Crete by throwing huge stones at them. If the strangers had already landed, he would burn them with his breath or shoot his bronze body into a fire, hug them tightly on him and burn them.\n\n\n\nThe end of Talo came when he met with the Argonauts returning from Colchis. Wanting the Argonauts to dock on the island faced the giant that kept them at bay. Then Medea, who traveled with them, enchanted Talos with her words, promising his immortality, so Jason was able to remove the nail in his heel that closed the one and only vein that ran through his whole body and contained land, killing him. Another version states that Philoctetes' father killed him, hitting him with an arrow in the same single weak spot. THE Talos appears in several coins of Phaistos, while his myth survives to this day.","html":""},{"id":219,"name":"Tantalus (Τάνταλος)","description":"Tantalus has been one of the most characteristic figures of divine and eternal condemnation in Greek Mythology, through which the question of \"Uncle\" and \"Holy\" was addressed.\n\nSpecifically Tantalus was treated as King of Phrygia based in Sipylo.

After the deluge of Deucalion and the withdrawal of water, the springs of lakes appeared, etc., were allegorically the children of the Ocean. For the interpretation of the sources they believed that the Ocean was the one that with underground currents fed the rivers that continued their perpetual movement (their flow) hence it was called \"absors\"\n\n\n\nAs a consequence of the first observations the Ocean was considered a huge circle that divided the celestial sphere into the above Eart hemisphere and the under Eart hemisphere so it was also called \"horizontal\". Under this perception all relevant myths featured the sunrise of the Sun of the Hoos, the stars and constellations being made by the Ocean and then be sunk, (to be sunk), also to him. And beyond the Ocean, the ancients believed that the grim Hades was.\n\nThus the Ocean like all other observed natural forces was ascended to the concept of God and even, in the sense of the original element, as Father of gods and things. Thus alongside the original divine Dynasty of Heaven and Gaia, the ancient Greeks (observers) created the divine dynasty of the father Ocean and mother Tithea (Tithus) from the union of which, according to the Theogenia of Hesiod, the three-thousand river gods (drivers) and the trishilian nymphs the so-called Oceans (i.e., the identical forms of the flow of their brothers) were born many human genera (i.e., the islanders and tributaries).\n\nUse the name: First to historically record the Ocean in the sense of the very large sea area was Herodotus where the term has since remained in global use in this sense.\n\nGood Arts: In Art the Ocean is initially represented circular having in the middle the earth, heaven and sea as in the shield of Hercules and Achilles. In the Alexandrian era (Greek period) he is represented as an old bearded semi-naked man with goat horns. Then in the Roman period as an old half-naked man sitting in a rectory whose mattress was the sea level, his headrest, Olympus, (the Eart), bringing to the head a small cover while on the right hand long scepter.
